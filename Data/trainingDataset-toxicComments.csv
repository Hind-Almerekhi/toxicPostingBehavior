celvcp2,"I used to work at this deli when I was a junior in high school. It was close to my home and my dad's work ( the two places I was normally at). So this guy lets call him Max was running four business out of one office. He ran the deli, a car wash, an ice cream parlor and real estate. Well not only did Max make his employees run the deli and the parlor, he also made only the guys go work at the car wash doing maintenance. Now this isn't all that bad, but when you have someone who constantly is staring down girls shirts, it starts to get a little old. But what really sent me over the edge was how he treated his employees. We had a young pregnant girl and the baby's father working there. The guy would not let the father go out with his girl friend to go to the baby appointments. Then Max really sent me over the edge, when he started to talk about me behind my back, while I was on the job none-the-less. He mentioned to one of the other employees, who I was friends with, that, that car guy thinks he is so cool, yet he is just another loser at a dead end job. This and the fact that since the deli did catering we had some big orders, so that week I came in early to help the other employees with work. He decided to cut nearly three and a half total hours of time, that I came in early, off my paycheck. The day after I found out about him talking behind my back I went in and quit before my shift that I had to work in an hour. And basically told him as kindly as possible to fuck off.",0,0,1

c1f6vgi,"Kids can be cruel and so are adults. Your child needs to learn about that shit and how to cope with it. Socialization is *huuuuge*. Probably more important than the actual school work. Any time you set your kid apart from the other generation, he/she is going to struggle a bit. Friendship is important. Companionship is important. Biologically we have evolved to work in groups. You can't just ignore the importance of that. You can be a real smart son of a bitch, but fat lot of good it does when you weird out the person interviewing you for that job you are trying to land. Socialization is a much larger life skill than you give it credit for. It's not just a matter of having friends to play video games with. Life is made up of personal relationships, and success has a lot to do with how competent we are at creating and maintaining those relationships. TL:DR; Knowledge is a powerful tool to equip your child with. An ability to 'win friends and influence people' is much more valuable though. Edit: If you really want your kid to be smarter than the rest of the public school plebes, just challenge him/her at home independently of the school's curriculum. And if you are worrying about advancing them faster than the others, most schools have accelerated programs. You can graduate a year or two early at least from a public high school, I'm pretty sure.",0,0,1

c1ixxau,"A mechanic tried to scam me. First thing I did was call my states Bureau of automotive repair and gave him a rundown of what I thought he was trying to do to me. The bureau rep didn't go over any details of how I thought he was trying to fuck me over, he simply asked if I got an invoice stating how much examining my vehicle would cost, and if I got the estimate for the work they were saying needed to be done in writing. I hadn't any of that. I left my vehicle there without getting a copy of the invoice that I signed when I was first there. The bureau rep told me that before I do anything, I need to get a copy of an invoice from them. It must have how much an examination of my car will cost in writing, and it must have a detailed account of their estimate on it. First thing I did when I got there was ask for the invoice. They handed it to me and it had none of what he said was supposed to be on it. I ripped out a copy, and that's when the shit hit the fan. They wanted the copy of the invoice that I ripped out. They *knew* what they were supposed to do, so that basically confirmed to me that they were trying to fuck me out of some cash. They were telling me I couldn't get my truck back until I paid them $85 for the estimate, *and* they wanted the copy of that invoice back! I was about to defend myself in a physical confrontation that I was sure was going to happen between me and the two I was arguing with, but then a stout hothead came into the office from the shop making it a three on one.

I called the bureau rep to let him know what just went down, and to my surprise, he told me he was 1 hour away, and he was on his way. Same day service! To shorten up the story, they ended up getting cited by the Bureau Of Automotive Repair for various violations. They probably got fined. I ended up diagnosing and fixing my vehicle myself.

cfjwb6q,"You may have to define what ""actually intelligent"" is, in this case. Where, exactly, is that boundary? Where is the spark that pushes something from just past lifeless metal and code into the realm of conscious and/or sapience? I agree with you, improving a program's skills at chess or Starcraft have more to do with statistics and game theory then identity. A neat trick. Teaching a computer to kick ass at Jeopardy is as simple as setting it up to do very fast, parallel equivalents of Google searches through prefabricated databases. These are baby steps. Kinda like when a kid starts vocalizing randomized sounds that fit the parent's language, then focuses on a given set based on the reactions. Give human tech some credit, even babies lack an identity and are eating, crapping machines at some point during their development. AI and related fields like information theory are extremely new by human standards. Do you think humanity is somehow special? Barring some amazing deus ex machina, they're just extremely complicated machines themselves. Humanity don't even fully understand its own biology. They are only just beginning to understand how the machinery of their own cells are built up by a compressed molecular code. They still have no idea how the mind works, short of the most blunt ""remove this piece, this happens. Inject this chemical, maybe sometimes this or that happens."" Humanity STILL has no idea what the basis of consciousness is. A simple recursive algorithm? Likely. A gift from God? Not so much. I wouldn't bet on the latter. But, no one knows and I won't discount it. The fact is, consciousness arose once, building itself up from inanimate rock, salts and metal. It happened here on earth and humanity was the beneficiary. If something happens once, it will happen again. Proof of concept. You may be right. Nothing HUMANS ever invent might accomplish it. But self modifying code is evolution in hyper-speed. And it's a force that can be steered. Humans are probably too dumb to work it out. After all, the complexity of a simulation (thoughts occuring in a human brain, for example) can never meet or exceed the complexity of the substrate they're being computed in due to physics being a bitch like that. Take your mind. Every function. Now, enlarge it all. Imagine you are a goddamn enormous mechanical entity. All clockwork. But through some weird trick of fate you're the size of a solar system. Because flesh is efficient and the physics of gears and mainsprings are not. Every function of your current human mind is duplicated exactly. But you're not made of living flesh. You experience some time lag because of the slower physical processes and speed limits in different materials involved... But your every thought, inclination or habit is the same. Are you alive?

The FBI under his administration doesn't go after felons who try to buy guns, which is a felony in of itself. They're free to go off and find a gun somewhere else, so he can turn around and say ""See our laws don't work, we need more"". Then you have the whole ""Fast and Furious"" incident where his administration ordered gun shops to sell guns to Mexican cartels, let the guns go into Mexico and be used to murder countless people, then he turns around and blames the US gun industry and gun owners for the violence. If a handful of ATF agents didn't grow a conscience and blow the whistle, this probably would have never been found out. The worst part is *he didn't even tell Mexico what he was doing*.

That's terrible. Also, you're kind of touching on a lot of points here that have to do with cultural fetishization so this will be a little long, and probably sound extremely strange and challenging to you. 1. It's insensitive, rude, and just really fucking ignorant to say that you're a big fan of an entire country/culture. So if you're awesome at Karate, great. If you speak Japanese, great. It doesn't mean that somehow you understand what it's like to carry the burden of Hiroshima on your shoulders. You don't have an understanding of what it's like to be inculcated into Japanese culture through years of schooling, visits to shrines, whatever. You've never taken the time to look at yourself in the mirror and realize that your ancestors were the ones who committed the rape of Nanjing. A race can't be reduced to ""karate and the language."" First and foremost, a race is how you are treated by other people. And you are not Japanese, and you will never be treated like you are Japanese. If you have stuff in common with the Japanese, great, I don't care, but saying that makes you Japanese is just plain inaccurate. It's a thousand little things that add up to make you Japanese, or Wodaabe, or American, or whatever. 2. A Japanese woman is not expected to abide by your conceptions of what she should be. Japanese women can and should be whatever they damn well want. Maybe they don't give a shit about karate, or maybe they don't even speak Japanese. Stereotypes, ESPECIALLY accurate ones, limit us. If you find a woman attractive because you live in Tokyo and she lives right next door to you, fine. If you find a woman attractive because she reminds you of the places you want to go someday, you're not attracted to her, you're attracted to your own dream.

dgybxks,"&gt; Honesty? Like as in being honest and direct with what you feel? Or tell her that today you saw some good porn and you spend the next 40 minutes masturbating to it. Lol Lmao, yes the first. But honestly, talking about the porn you both like to watch with your partner can be a boundary breaker and give more insight to what they're into. Me and my partner have even watched porn together a few times. &gt; I think I never judged anything she said. But I did judge a lot in what she didn't say, what she portrayed but didn't verbally said. Well, maybe she caught onto that, too. It's hard to begin to say things you sense judgement about before you even start talking, you know? &gt; Then she'd make a remark about me being obsessed with anime or something. Nothing too big but I'm self conscious You gotta tell people that comments like that make you feel like you can't share things because it's something you're sort of insecure about. Otherwise, resentment builds. &gt; But then I say, ""you don't make it any easier, I feel either you just don't care what I like and disregard what I tell you or you'd make witty remarks about it. Make me feel you judge me for it."" You come across very accusatory when you keep using the word ""you"" when you talk about your own feelings. Maybe it would have helped to say ""I could have brought this up sooner, but I'm sort of insecure about some of my interests, and when I get teased for it, it's hard to feel like I can share things about my interests"". Do you see the difference? &gt; Just continue asking questions about it, make it sound like you would like to know about it and why they're interested. It engages you and your partner, makes your partner feel like he's being listened to and you respect his hobbies. Even if in reality you don't give two shits about it. Well, the key is so actually give a shit, even if it doesn't particularly interest you. Getting to know someone is one of the many joys of a relationship, learning about the things they love is a part of it. I bet if you sat her down and showed her one of your favorite animes, she would have thought a lot differently about them, and probably even see why you like them.

I've only recently started coming out my shell and improving but it really fucked up my early-mid teen years. Edit: to expand on this, when I got a bit older and realised how timid I was as a result of this, it made me angry and resentful as I felt I didn't fit in socially. So to 'make up' for what I perceived as a lack of confidence, I started acting extremely aggressive and violent to anyone who confronted me as I felt that I had to overcompensate for how timid I really was by acting in an 'intimidating' manner.",0,0,1

One day I was laughing about something weird the kid had done, and my dad said ""SunnyNorth, you have a choice to make. You can join in and be one of the people that make his life miserable, or you can be the one friendly face in a sea of bullies.

Some smuggle themselves in a ferry to Metro Manila where the economy is exploding and thousands of foreigners live. They'll sleep near busy high economic zones and beg for cash. They'll then send the money back to the southern provinces so they can continue having another 15 children lol. Edit - I don't give out money anymore, some buy shoes glue and inhale it to get high.

cfamd1p,"The only way you can objectively measure any form of art is by its intent. I honestly believe that Mozart's music is not objectively better than Justin Bieber's at *being music*. At being complex and innovative, of course it is. But 'good music' is not something that can be defined at all. Hell, even 'complex and innovative' is up for debate. The intent of Justin Bieber's music is to make young girls dance, feel loved, and get wet wets in their special place. He gets a 10/10 for that and thus his music is perfect, because it achieves all goals. The intent of Nirvana's music is not to make young girls feel loved or to make them wet, and at that, Justin Bieber can rightfully say he is better than Kurt Cobain at something. Never said it was something worth being proud of, but it's a goal and he's achieved it. I agree with your opinions on music, but I refuse to concede that there is an objective fact about what music is good and isn't, because the truth is that all music is equal - but *not the same*. Juggalos love ICP because they have their own culture. Radiohead, however much I love them, doesn't have such a devoted following to the extent that it's pretty much a full-blown gang. In that area, Insane Clown Posse wins. To that point, 2 Chainz's intent is to be cool, fly, and make music about having a good time. Tupac is all about meaning and telling truth. Neither of these things is more valid than the other. Art, and music especially, can be about whatever it wants. Of course I have my own opinions and will gravitate towards my own taste, but if a band wants to make music about fucking chicks and drinking beer, I will not try to say they're any less than Radiohead, because the truth is, they're probably not even trying to be like Radiohead. Hope you understand what I'm trying to say, I tend to ramble sometimes. EDIT: If you want to get really into it, I guess you could argue that some intentions are purer and more worthy than others; for example you could argue that wanting to move your audience to tears is a purer notion than wanting to make your audience have sex with each other.

Using trimesters for gestation markers make it easier to understand where a woman is in the process, as opposed to months. Using weeks can be more accurate for development, but harder to predict accurately without invasive testing. *edited for way too many stupid typos.*",0,0,1

cf8pgvd,"Damn, I have a million of these stories and I keep thinking of more. From the student perspective again, sorry. I learned both automatic and manual, so I've had several driving instructors. The worst - and I'm sure he remembers it as the worst too - was with a newly qualified driving instructor. I'd only had one or two lessons before (taster lessons with another company), never practised in anyone else's car either. He spent a lot of time telling me how weird that was, didn't I have a boyfriend who would teach me? Then he kept making jokes about women being bad at parking. We did a circuit of the area around my house, which includes a junction at the top of a hill. I struggled to keep the car level while accelerating up off the hill to make the turn. I rolled back a little, tried again, did the same. I panicked a little, but was pretty sure I could do it - but the driving instructor didn't think so. He had a huge go at me and I just froze up, I thought I'd be stuck there forever. I just couldn't do anything. Eventually, I got up the hill, turned and the instructor directed me home. By now I was crying. Then, outside my house, he screamed at me about how useless I was and how I wasn't ready to drive, how I must have lied about having had a taster lesson before. Then he made me swap into the passenger seat and sit there practising putting my seatbelt on and opening the door safely, because apparently that's all I was fit for. This lasted all of twenty minutes and he still demanded the full Â£20 for a proper hour long lesson. Needless to say, found another instructor but he actually had the audacity to call me up a few months later and ask why I never booked another lesson, then passed judgement on the new instructor and company I'd chosen.

cgspiac,"So I was a stupid college student paying their way through school. I had made the dumb-shit decision at some point that ""I'm an amazing driver, I can let my insurance slide until I get my finances in order"" and then never did. Where I live is full of backroads and most people prefer to use them to get around, as they cut between the major highways. This particular one I had driven for years, knew by heart, never had an issue on. However, as everyone does on these roads, I didn't give the speed limit as much credence as on a highway. Crested a hill doing 10 over, saw a trooper at the bottom of the hill. Sure enough, he followed me to the highway, and then pulled me over. Of course I didn't have insurance, but I told him I had left my card at home, so he let me go with just the ticket and a summons to present proof of insurance. I went online as soon as I got where I was going to buy insurance, but the cards were going to show it as starting the next day. Gut-check. __________________________________ I spent weeks freaking out about this, but showed up with the proof that I had insurance the day AFTER I was pulled over, not sure if it would help or hurt.

dcmuom2,"&gt;You mean the election where we won the popular vote? Pro tip: No one cares, at all. Complaining that you won the popular vote shows that you either don't have much political experience, or more likely, you do but are ignoring. The popular vote is meaningless for many reasons, the least of which being that it doesn't count. If the election was just a straight popular vote, Trump would have campaigned for that. And voting would be done differently. For instance a conservative in California has no reason to vote, they can't possibly effect anything, so they probably won't. Liberals have similar problems in Red states. So a popular vote lacks that dissincentive to vote so would have a crap ton more votes. So if we were doing popular vote, Trump could have very well still won. But please, keep whinging about your favorite trivia piece. &gt;The Bernistas, the Jill Steiners, the dumbasses who didn't even bother to vote... Everyone but yourself.

ch5tajf,"So this is a bit of a long story, will include TL;DR at bottom I met my fiancee when we were about 11 years old. I had actually skipped school on a tuesday, and just said screw it to stay home. After messing around on the family PC for a bit (mainly playing Diablo) I got a bit bored and started messing around on a website my parents used to play games on all the time. (aparently its now being used to help plant trees... &gt;.&gt;) Called Pogo.com Whilst on Pogo I played some random games, Pop-it, Chess, and stumbled into Checkers. Being dumb, I said screw it and went into the Masters lobby and played a couple rounds. I did, and promptly got my ass handed to me. After hanging out for a while I noticed people chatting in the small chat window below. Watching the chat I became a bit fond of some of the people talking and joined in. Simple small talk here and there, met some nice people. And I continued coming to the chat room, a lot. With the passing months I started basicly going daily. Being a huge shut in reality, it was nice to be able to just openly talk with a lot of people. Some people I still talk to today (Thank god none of them lied about there ages lol) Well after about about a week of being grounded from a computer by my parents, I came back. Hopped back on and started chatting again, when someone new caught my attention. I began chatting with her and, honestly we hated each other. She couldn't stand me, when I would come into the room she normally would either leave or go very quiet. I continued attempting to make small talk with her, try to be nice and friendly, but it didnt work out to well. Fast forward a little over a year. It was just about after my 13th birthday when I hopped online after school and seemed like no one I talked to was on. Except her, so, being me, and by me I mean dumb, I tried talking to her again. She actually was very calm with me. No hostility in her words, and we kept chatting. Turns out she was actually really upset and sad. Her recent boyfriend had just broken up with her, and she really needed to talk to someone. Guess it was destiny that I logged on when I did. Fast forward about another year. After that night we hit it off. Left behind all that pent up hostility we had for each other and started over. It was great, we found out more about each other. Like how she lived in Virginia, while I lived in California. Our birthday is only 14 days apart. She has a huge obsession with cooking and loves it all the time. So I got a little ballsy. And I asked her if we could meet one day. Face to face and see where it would take us. Now, by no means and I rich, or are my parents. Hell the ""Family computer"" was my moms birthday gift she barely used cause we took it over. So i saved up. I was the super geek through high school and I used to sell burned CD's for some spare cash. Saved up a bit of cash, but ultimately not enough. So i went to my parents, and she went to hers. My mother was terrified and hated the idea. Enough to repeatedly tell me no and she didn't care if I was paying for over half. She wasn't having it. My Father on the other hand was a lot of relaxed about it and told me to go for it. So I did. Her parents fronted me the rest of the money for the air fair, and I hopped a plane to VA, where I met her for the first time. It was amazing. Spent a month out in VA, then went home. Did another year of high school, same thing, Came back this time for 3 months. Went back home, finish out high school, about a month after, I packed up all my stuff, told my parents I will see them around and I left, and haven't been back since. (If my job permits I am attempting to go back home with her for Christmas) *Her side of the story* She was actually released from the hospital a couple days before we met for the first time. She was in a pretty bad car accident and was made to stay at home for the next couple weeks, which eventually turned into her doing all of her school online. She got bored while doing class work and hopped onto a website her mom played games on all the time. TL;DR: I skipped school one day when I was 11, which led me to a chat room, where I met my her, we went from hating each other to loving each other. 5 years later, I hopped a plane, came out every summer, and moved out here.

Him:""... Grandmother"" Me:""Okay I'll give her a call. She loves lasagna"" Saturday Morning: - Breakfast Lasagna Him: ""I hate you"" Me:""No problem I love you enough for the both of us."" Saturday for Lunch: - Now crying at sight of Lasagna ""I don't like it"" Me:"" I haven't seen you try it at all. If you try it and really don't like it that's fine, other wise you try it"" With tears at the corners of his eyes and with Herculean effort he finally takes a spoonful of lasagna and brings it to his mouth. With hate in his eyes he looks at me as the spoon goes in his mouth. His eyes drop down to his plate in surprise and his arm goes protectively around his plate. A full adult helping seems to vanish into his maw. He looks at me and says ""That's not what I thought it was. Can I have more"" He receives his second piece and goes about his day. At dinner I ask the kid what he wants for dinner and I get this ""Can we have lasagna... Its my favorite""... Sure it took 5 days but its now several years later and there is nothing that he won't at least give an honest try to because he knows that he'll have it until he tries it...

Davies was also pretty crap at writing story arcs, but I felt like he at least understood what the show should be and how to use most of the characters.

I got off work a little early and had to pick up some friends from the airport later that night so I was sitting on the hood of my car smoking a cigarette when I hear this little kid crying over in the parking lot of the liquor store I always parked by. This liquor store had a little alley behind it next to some train tracks. Anyways, I hear this little girl crying and eventually make out that she's screaming 'he took it all from me,' typical tantrum stuff. After it keeps going on for a minute, I decide to check on this kid to make sure she finds her dad or whatever. Instead of a little kid throwing a hissy fit in a parking lot, I see a full grown woman prostrate on the train tracks screaming 'he took it all from me!' Over and over and over. I yelled at her to ask if she was okay and she screamed at me to leave, which I told her I couldn't do. After this goes on for a minute; I say 'fuck it' and hop the fence to go be with her on the tracks. In between screaming at me and screaming 'he took it all from me,' she tells me a loose story of how her boyfriend betrayed her. After a bit, I see the train is coming and tell her we better get going, to which she protested vehemently. I know it should've been obvious from the start, but it hadn't occurred to me that she was trying to get hit by the train. I plead and plead but she wouldn't budge and the train was coming and coming fast. When the train was maybe fifty yards away, I tackled her into the gravel and laid on top of her so she couldn't move, but she was bigger than me, so it wasn't easy. I remember feeling the wind rushing up and briefly considering how close my feet were to getting crushed. Afterwards she hit me and I told her I had to get help. She told me I couldn't call the police, so I told her I was gonna leave. I went back to my car and immediately called the police and they came and got her. I still remember what happened to her and sometimes I still hear her screaming 'he took it all from me.' Tl;dr: heard a girl throwing a tantrum, turned out to be a woman trying to kill herself, had to tackle her off the train tracks and call the cops",0,0,1

cf1p44o,"During that awkward developmental phase that was ninth grade, my two mutual friends, Michael, and Emily, decided that they were going on a date. To add to the excitement, it was going to be on the Fourth of July! All of this was perfectly normal, except the fact they insisted they bring me along. Fast forward a couple hours, and I had ridden my bike to the park where they intended to meet up. To my suprise, the date was going well, they hit it off and both seemed like they were ready to take their relationship out of the ""FriendZone"". This was true until my friend decided that we should go to Jack in the Box for lunch. Why anyone would decide to conduct a first date in that place is beyond me. We arrived and had our lunch, and it was relatively smooth, that was until after lunch when it became more ""fluid"". As we were sitting in the grass, Michael stood up, promptly excused himself, and hurried to the bathroom. About a minute later, I received a panicked text from him, saying Michael: Dude I need your help Jaydainel: What's up? Michael: I have diarrhea, It's all over my pants, My mom's on her way, do something about Emily Jaydainel: Are you fucking serious? Michael: Just do something about it Jaydainel: okay fine, but you owe me one Having received these panicked texts from Michael, my pre-adolescent brain came up with two possibilities, one, was to straight up tell her that Michael had shat himself, and that she should go home, or to try to trick her into thinking we had left, and deal with those consequences later. I ended up commanding her to get me a drink from the nearby vending machine just as the fireworks started. At that point it was dark enough that I managed to hide until after the fireworks while Michael and I hid until his mom showed up. The plan was to tell her we got pushed off our spot by some drunks, and that My mom wanted me home early so we had to leave immediately after the fireworks. Everything was going according to plan, and as we walked discreetly towards his mothers car, she appeared. It never occurred to us that she would want to leave immediately upon being basically abandoned. So there we were, me, red-faced and in social agony. Her, standing in utter disgust and contempt for the date that had abandoned her. And last and not least, Michael, standing there with his pants halfway down his legs, bawling out of sheer humiliation upon being caught like this. Needless to say there was no second date.

dburxzl,"[**Faith is flawed**](http://www.darthcontinent.com/2010/03/faith-is-flawed.html), the gist of my feelings about organized religion are in that post. I could add that people fervently believing in their religion are doing something similar to anthropomorphizing their dog; they're laying the notions dictated by doctrine on top of something that has no basis in reality. You talk to the dog as if it were your best friend, you hope that your dog would magically drag you out of the house if you were knocked out and it were on fire, but in reality the dog might just GTFO and leave you to roast. I'm agnostic and regardless of the bullshit spouted by religious and secular people alike on their conviction about the existence or nonexistence of a god or whatever superior entities might have created the universe, I strive to maintain an open mind. Certainly, if God does exist, I'd like to punch it in the face for the bad things in life, but paradoxically at the same time I'd want to thank it warmly for enabling the good things in the first place. If some all-encompassing, nebulous *force* is responsible for creation, I might piss in it while at the same time pouring it a tasty beverage, along similar lines. More people on both extremes would do well to have humility before the fact that things outside our ability to perceive may just be that, it doesn't mean that they definitively do or don't exist simply because we *will* that they do or don't.

(She was actually just waiting to find the right excuse like a slumber party with her girlfriends; it just hadn't gelled yet.) Anyway, this girl is the epitome of sweet and naive. Not especially the brightest...? But very sweet. She's seriously upset this night at work and doesn't know what to do. So I spend the entire shift calming her down and telling her that he's just bullshitting her and there aren't any satanists (while wondering to myself if there are any satanists), and that if he really said that stuff she should definitely stay away from him. So around 11 she is feeling better and clocks out and heads out to her car. 2 minutes later she comes running back in completely freaking out and hysterical. She takes me out to her car, and written in the dust on her back window is what appears to be *latin writing and a pentagram in a circle.* She stayed at my place that night. I didn't sleep much. (Yes, she left still a virgin.) Nothing ever happened to her aside from her losing a lot of sleep over this. She never went out with the guy again. But I did some asking around (small town), and it turns out that the guy's parents were the ones who owned the lodge. TL;DR: Satanic script on a virgin coworker's car.",0,0,1

One night I went with my roommate to one of the local bowling alleys because we were going to meet my girlfriend and some of her friends for some drinks. Well, his mom showed up to watch him bowl while we were all hanging out at the bar. Turns out that she got pissed, told me that I was an ass for being there because I should know that she was going to be there. So shortly after this exchange she went over to our house while we were still out (she had a key because she did my roommates laundry from time to time) and went through my room trashing anything that she had ever given me, dumped some of my bottles of alcohol, and left some of her clothes in my room and in my bed. She did all this in hopes that me and my girlfriend would go back to my place and she would find all this stuff, think I was cheating on her and break up with me. It's a good thing that we ended up going back to my girlfriends house that night and I went back to my house the next morning alone.

c7q7gfw,"WARNING. A TEXT WALL INCOMING. A few more typical older sister hurting little brother stories. First. I had just arrived home from the hospital where I had been recovering from a urinary tract infection for a few weeks, and my dad had put together a playground in our backyard. I was about six or seven so my brother was either three or four. Now, I was pretty spoiled. I WAS THE PRINCESS. And my brother, rightfully, was my slave. On this particular day I had climbed on top of the playground and had told him to bring me my jump rope. He did not comply with my demands so I warned him that if I didn't get what I wanted, bad things would happen. Still, he didn't listen. So I got down from my play escape, retrieved my jump rope, which was plastic coated and stung like hell when it hit you, and beat him. I have the worst memory of throwing him down on the ground, kicking him until he rolled over, then whipping him with my jump rope until he was red. My dad whooped my ass that day... Second. My brother and I were playing airplane pilots and we had to dress up as them. They stereotypically wear a scarf, so I put a scarf on my brother and tied it on really well with my special knot. That I forgot how to untie. And apparently his scarf was too tight. My parents tell me that he had literally turned purple when I brought him inside for help but they eventually untied it and he was fine. Third. This was a collaborative torture. My cousin and I were playing surgeon with my brother one year at a family gathering of some sort. My brother was on the operating table (guest bed) and my cousin were ready to operate with the most advanced technology available (safety scissors). He had a birth mark by his belly button that we decided was dangerous and had to go. No we didn't cut him up, we just scratched at him a bunch until it got all red and we decided that the procedure had been a success due to the fact that he was now in tears. This last one is about my dog. I was a princess and she was my noble steed so I dressed her up all pretty, tried to ride her, gave up on that, and put her in the stable until dinner. In other words, she was in a tutu, had a clip on her tail and ear, had a sparkly rope leash, and had been tied up to our fence until my dad looked out the window at dinner and saw our dog almost passed out from heat exhaustion. She was fine. My rear was not. Many spankings were received. I was the devil.

c7tholc,"Here's what I usually do, so far with each girl it's worked pretty well. Keep in mind that my method is a bit of a long play and if you want to date the girl; if you want to know how to do it in a club or at a bar that's pretty simple: Don't be ugly and make sure both of you are drunk. * **Engage in conversation with the girl** - Obviously the first step, but the way you handle this is seals you fate if she wants to be attracted to you or not. You want to be nice to the girl, but not nice enough that you doom yourself to the friend zone. Then you got to show that you're interested in her. A wonderful protip I've learned from Tucker Max. **If she's an average looking girl, keep telling her that she's pretty. If she's a hot girl, compliment her intelligence.** The point here is that you're showing her that you are interested in her, but not in the short term. At this point you should ask for her number, but not for a date, but just to hang out with her. * **Hang out with the girl** - Now, if you're an attractive casanova you can just skip this step and wait a couple days and ask her out, but for me, I don't have high points in looks but I am great at conversation. So I invite her to hang out with me while I'm with friends. I do this to be friendly; I'm not really looking for anything so I don't actually care if she hangs out with me or not because I'm already with friends. But if she does agree to hang out then she'll get to know more about me and my life. Hopefully you will have friends who don't suck and will compliment you and talk highly of you. Nothing that's desperate wingmanning, but enough that she thinks highly of you. * **Live your life** - Now here's where most guys usually fuck it up. Remember those moments where you think that a girl likes you, she's texting you all the time and always talking on FB, and then suddenly she just flat out doesn't talk to you anymore? The key here is that a girl likes a dude who is independent and has his own life. Meaning you don't need to text her every single day. Seriously, play it cool and just continue doing what you're doing. If you're in class and get a text from her, ignore it for a little bit. Same thing when you're out with your friends. **The key here is that you want to make yourself seem well cultured and slightly mysterious**. You want to appear to be someone who is constantly doing things and stuff and has a wide social circle. Even if that's not exactly true sometimes, the simple act of not replying immediately works wonders. It shows that you're not needy and aren't checking your phone every ten minutes to see if she texts you back (even though that might very well be the case). * **Ask her help with something** - Girls, and actually to be honest, everyone, loves being considered valuable. Especially if it's something that you perceive them to be an expert in. Also, from a girl perspective it's kind of cute in a derpy way when a man admits that he doesn't know how to do something and needs help. A good example is asking a girl to help you out with an assignment or a test. In one situation I got this one girl who I had no interest in help me out with some Liberal Arts homework, mostly because I knew she was smarter than me and that she didn't hate me. What I didn't realize is that in terms of attraction this works wonders: you are respecting the fact that this girl is intelligent and you are also spending extended periods of time with them for a task which is usually considered pretty boring on it's on. It's also an act that allows you two to be along together without it being awkward. After three months of having her help me with studying I found out that this girl was head over heels for me without me doing any sort of game at all. **One important thing to do though is remember to always thank them for helping you out.** This shows that you appreciate them. * **Get drunk together** - After awhile some feelings might surface, but because, if you're like me, you haven't asked her out yet, there hasn't been any actual forward feelings of affection, outside of maybe some casual flirting. But if the both of you get drunk, suddenly you guys get a little friendlier and some feelings might accidentally slip out. Remember though, don't be a creeper and stay sober while she gets drunk, this should be mutual. * **Ask her out** - At this point you're pretty much lining yourself up where the last thing that should be needed is for you to ask the question. One thing that people usually do though is that they get cold feet, because they're emotionally invested and this point and don't want to see the crushing reality of what if the girl says no. There is an easy way to ask this while minimizing the fallout of rejection. Probably at this point you guys might have some mutual people you know between each other. So go and ask to go out to dinner or a movie and then casually bring up the option to go with friends or just have it be you two. *We could go see Django Unchained, do you want John and Alice and Tim to come? Or it could be just the two of us*. The reason why this option works is that it also allows the girl to have an easy, non-awkward way to reject you just in case she says no. That's how I usually do it. It takes a bit, but I will say that for each girl I have been interested in I have followed this rough template and have still managed to get the girl in the end. This has worked with girls who I honestly to be consider model 10's to nerdy girls to girls who I have absolutely nothing in common with.",0,0,1

He'll get rid of net neutrality, gut environmental regulations. There are just not enough people who care about those things so he will get away with it, no problem. He will build a few miles of border wall and claim it's a huge success stopping the illegals, and it'll probably be somewhat true because people will get the message and illegal immigration will go down. When it comes to things like rebuilding the infrastructure, he will get bipartisan support because the democrats actually believe in government and want the government to work and will cooperate where they can.

We had this setup where there's a projector showing the guy's talk and a smaller projector to the side with the video of him (we also broadcast video of us). Except he never turns his video on. All that's there is his profile picture, displayed extra large on this projector. His profile picture is a black man wearing lots of gold chains and waving a pistol. The words ""THUG LIFE"" are printed in huge letters on the picture. According to the picture on his CV he was actually a white guy with a quite fair complextion. That already sort of did it, but to make things worse he also did not speak English (not gonna get into French stereotypes...). Everyone in the conference room just cringed for 15 minutes while he muttered something unintelligible into the microphone and we collectively tried not to stare at his profile picture. There were no questions. He did not get the job. However he did become an office meme for some time. tl;dr - If you have a skype interview: cut your hair, turn your video on, and change your damn profile picture.",0,0,1

cnp8oev,"If my father was a pedophile, I would have probably been sexually abused at home as a child along with my sibling, so yeah. I'd still look at him like a monster lmao. If he were to not abuse my brother or I, but other children, for instance neighbors or cousins. I'd look at him like a monster. If he didn't abuse anyone and just watched child pornography (on the regular or not) I'd look at him like a monster. Actually, this happened with me but not with my own father (He's a good man and a decent person) When I was about in the fourth grade, I had a good friend and she had moved in with her father and her step-mom for the year because her mom was recovering from a brain tumour. She moved across the country. I was ten. I often slept over her house and vice versa, I often went to family holidays with her and when she was moving back her father asked me if I wanted to go with him to visit her when she would go back. I begged my mom to let me go, she declined and I was pissed because I was a bratty ol' ten year old. A year later, near Halloween a couple friends and I decide that we want to go trick-o-treat and visit their house to say hi to her family. Her father wasn't present, but her step mom was all giddy to see us again. Turned out, her dad was in prison for child pornography. He actually had a room in the house that no one was allowed to enter, I remember entering it once and we just sat on the couch and watched TV, but it was usually locked because it was supposed to be his ""man-cave."" I look back and I wonder if she was abused and if I missed all the signs. I haven't spoken to her or seen her since she moved away. I wonder what would have happened to me if I was allowed to go on that cross country trip as a ten year old with a strange man. No, it should not be treated in the same respect as other mental illnesses or addictions because it is sickening and it **RUINS** lives. You are not only a danger to yourself, but to innocent people (in this case children.) Aren't most people confined when they are a danger to others? Personally, I feel pedophiles should be treated the same way. Confine them.

detqa2e,"I didn't save anyone's life, but my training instructor (the Air Force equivalent of a drill sergeant) saved mine. In basic training, the amount of time you have to eat is very limited, you're always tired, and you're always hungry. When you're eating, you continuously see tables ahead of you getting up and leaving one at a time. The closer the leaving tables are getting to you, the less time you have to eat, so you're just cramming as much as possible. I was just about to start finishing up my french fries when I realized I could no longer breathe. I was kind of an idiot, in that rather than immediately indicating to someone that I was choking, I tried to take a sip of water to push the food down my throat. The water went halfway down my throat, didn't push the food through, and ended up coming back out. It probably looked like I was vomiting, but it was just the water that had no place to go coming back out. The guy sitting next to me gave me a disgusted look when this happened, and I just started frantically pointing at my throat. I guess he saw the fear in my eyes that was then returned in his eyes as understanding dawned in him. He just said the word *choking?* and I nodded yes as fast as I could, as he yelled for a training instructor. My T.I, this man who had been making my life a living hell for the last three weeks literally jumped over the staff table he was at, sprinted over to me, and began giving me the Heimlich maneuver. This dude had me breathing again after two pumps, for lack of a better term. He really knew what he was doing. Apparently it's not a very rare thing for trainees to choke on their food, as everyone's so desperate to eat as much as they can, as quickly as they can. He made sure I was okay, and oddly enough the thing that stuck out to me is that he was treating me like a person, not like a trainee in basic training. That didn't last long. All in all it lasted about 10-15 seconds total, but those moments were absolutely terrifying. Props to my Staff Sergeant for saving me. He made my life hell, then he saved it.",0,0,1

cffuors,"I was extremely afraid of [Terry Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fox) when I was a kid. It didn't help that they showed us a documentary every year in elementary school that featured eerie 80s music while you see him slowly coming up a hill with a creepy limp. Also keep in mind that it's old vintage footage and is being played on a shitty VHS, so the audio is crappy. It's pretty bad when your Mom has to give you a note to give to your teacher saying that you find the video emotionally disturbing and need to sit outside the classroom while the rest of the class watches the video. Especially since he's a Canadian hero... I guess due to the trauma from the video as kid, I still am mildly weirded out by photos of him, at least the ones featuring his prosthetic leg. Maybe it's PTSD :P jk. PS: I should add that I had a wild imagination as a kid and we were obviously taught that most people end up with cancer at some point in their life; however, the teachers were too foolish to make it clear to us poor little kids that there are numerous types of cancer and different severities and that some cancers have become much more treatable now, and that not everyone is bound to get cancer and have to get an arm or leg cut of and of some scary doll-like prosthetic arm attached to them.

dgfzjco,"What a lot of people don't know is that hallucinations are actually quite common. [Some sources say 1 in 20](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-common-are-hallucinations/) but I personally think everybody has them. The brain is weird as shit. The time it takes for light to hit your eyes and be translated to your brain is lightning fast, but in a survival situation it may not be fast enough. So it tries to predict things before it has all the information. This is why a coat or chair out of the corner of your eye looks like a murderer. Your brain saw a vaguely human shape, jumped to the conclusion that it was a human, and then jumped to the conclusion that it means you harm. The comment by /U/AFreshStartVI is a great example. He and his cousin (or she and her cousin, whatever) saw a chair out of the corner in their peripheral vision and assumed it was a human. They probably thought it was the cousin's dad (or the brain decided to see the cousin's dad) because from previous experience that could safely be assumed to be there. The brain doesn't stop there though. It's constantly doing this and unless it makes us jump we don't really notice. Auditory hallucinations are the most common and I personally have experienced these. When I was a kid my bedroom was on the first floor and every other bedroom in the house was on the second floor. My room was also right by the stairs. Many many times late at night (10-11pm, I was really young) I would hear my mom calling my name on the first floor. I would peek my head out of my room and yell into the pitch black darkness ""WHAT??"". She was never there. I waited by the stairs for her to walk back up and she never did. I would ask her in the morning and she would tell me she never called my name. To see a parent walk by that's not really there would certainly freak me out. But your brain probably jumped to the conclusion that it was time for your dad to be walking around the house. It expected to see him so it saw him. I am no expert, this is my internet learning at work here, but it seems to me like your brain simply made a really terrible assumption. Or your dad astral projects and you have The Gift.",0,0,1

cfh82h9,"When I was 13, completely to my surprise, I received a BB gun for Christmas. I'm female and grew up in a city, so a BB gun was not even on my radar of things to own, much less something I would even be allowed. I was kind of confused when I opened it, but then my step-dad was super, super jazzed about it and I realized it was more for him. It did give us something to bond over, though. I wasn't allowed to keep it or use it unsupervised, but we would do target practice in the backyard and, to my delight, I discovered that I'm a damn good shot. We'd even do small bets, which I usually won. It didn't take me long to figure out where the BB gun was kept, as I was extremely snoopy when I was alone in the house and bored. I would take it out and shoot random stuff like the fence, but nothing overly destructive. At this time, I had somewhat of a weird obsession with these neighbors in the top flat behind us. They were on the next street over, our backyards abutted. They had huge windows with no shades, so I could see into their living room and bedroom. They left the lights on a lot even when they weren't in the room, and I began to watch them. I had binoculars. It sounds really creepy and I guess it is, but I have a fucked up family and to me, this couple looked like they were living the most perfect life. I just kind of wanted to get lost in it. At some point, my BB gun playing and obsession with my neighbors met in a fit of boredom... me bored is often the precursor for something destructive and stupid. So, I got bored with shooting the fence and I got bored of just watching my neighbors, and was struck by the brilliant idea to shoot their windows. I don't think I consciously was doing it to get a reaction, but they did react and I found it kind of thrilling. This continued for a while, maybe a month, at times when I was home alone. I shot other windows, too, I thought I was being really clever by keeping the lights off and by however I arranged the window and shades being open. Then, one night after I'd played sniper, after my parents came home, there was a knock on the door. The neighbors had figured out who was responsible and came over to ask my parents to tell me to knock it off. They were kinda freaked out and pissed (rightfully so), and furthermore, I had damaged one of the windows. I honestly hadn't meant to, I had figured that with such a distance between us, the BBs wouldn't arrive with damaging force. Needless to say, I got in huge trouble and was majorly shamed by my parents, to the point that the memory of this is deeply mortifying. I was grounded and had a planned horseback trip canceled, plus I had to pay to fix the window. Those neighbors moved out not long after and I always wondered if I was the reason why. The new neighbors put up curtains and I wondered if they were warned about me, but either way, I felt ashamed and embarrassed and wouldn't have done it again anyway. This is one of my family's favorite stories to trot out and laugh about and I fucking hate it. They love telling new people, 'Have you heard about spankygrrl's sniper days? Oh, no? Well, get a load of this...' and basically I just want to shrivel up and die in shame. (Edited to add line breaks)",0,0,1
c0jgsb4,"Vin Diesel was visiting the gym to which I used to belong. He was totally focused on his workout. Didn't say a word or even make eye contact with anyone else. Wasn't rude or anything. Just completely wrapped up in what he was doing. And he was moving a serious amount of weight around. I poked Jimmy Buffet in the knee. He was there the weekend his sister's restaurant opened outside Mobile, Alabama. He showed up to do a few acoustic songs out on the deck. I was sitting on the steps leading to the lower deck (where the ""stage"" was) and he stopped beside me as he was shaking hands with everyone on his way through. I didn't know who it was; to me it was just some guy with his ass in my face while I was sitting on the steps with my friends. So I jabbed him in the knee and said, ""Look out, dude."" He looked down and said, ""Oh, I'm sorry man,"" and extended his hand for a shake. So I shook Jimmy Buffet's hand and he then played a truly enjoyable one-man set. Going way, way back, I encountered former NBA player Donyell Marshall in during his rookie season with the Golden State Warriors. He was at the bar me, my wife and friends were visiting.

Well, me and the two girls I was with hadn't heard the song before and so had no idea how the tune went, and I felt like a total loser for not knowing how it went because the rest of the class all seemed to know it. The teacher just gave us a piece of paper with the lyrics on and let us get on with it. The group that went before us were, lo and behold, the popular girls and one of them played the piano really beautfully while the rest of them sang it really well. It was very good. However, we'd thought it was a good idea just get use one of those 'beats' you get on an electronic keyboard as backup and just sort of make the tune up as we went along. I have no idea why any of us thought that this was a good idea, but the entire class, including the teacher, were laughing at how shit we were. I was so mortified that I just stopped singing along and stood there. I looked at one of the other girls and she had done the same, so there was the poor third girl soldiering on, carrying on with this awful, messed up version of the song while the class roared with laughter. It felt like it went on forever and I wanted to die. I literally, and I do mean literally in this instance, wanted to die every time I heard Wonderwall for many, many years after this experience.

dcnymj4,"Steven Universe - It has extremely relatable and likeable characters and that, much more than the narrative itself (which is pretty good anyways), is what is most alluring about the show. I feel a sense of familiarity and comfort while watching it and that all stems from the protrayal of those characters and their very credible and sometimes even complex relationships. It's also impressive how it manages to address social and even political issues with tact, using very direct, but effective, metaphors that connect directly the characters and storyline, making it feel natural and not ""forced in"". Rick and Morty - Extremely fun over-the-top and self aware humor paired with an episodic structure that allows us to enjoy their wacky personalities when confronting a variety of otherworldly situations. Later into the series the overarching theme of Rick's crimes and the consequences of his actions came at just the right time when the show needed expansion on his character after previous teasing. This is the case of a series built on feel and passion over planning and careful management but the raw talent of everyone involved shines through, and the shows themes are communicated in a more direct and pure way than with a heavily scripted and paced show. Gravity Falls - In contrast to R&amp;M, this one feels like the creators knew what they were doing from the start, and that gave them the opportunity to polish each aspect of the series to a mirror finish at each point. Nothing felt out of left field and even the episodic first stretch of the series gave us insight into the relationship and personalities of Dipper and Mabel. The spectacular ending was the result of careful planning and great execution from everyone. Bojack Horseman - This one is here for the writing. Bojack feels real in HS portrayal of a deeply flawed, damaged individual, his quest of betterment and the ultimate impossibility of him being a better person, which is the reality for many people. It's impressive to me how a show set in a world with anthropomorphic animals has the most accurate portrayal of imperfect, real human beings I have seen in a cartoon this far.

de0ie36,I'm probably not the right person to talk to you but I can't just have nobody answer you (although people probably will). First thing. It is okay to hold a grudge against people. Especially when you have a reason to do so which you have. There are a ton of people out there who don't understand mental illnesses. And if friends leave you because of that then they don't deserve you. It's hard and it hurts like shit. But in some point of your life you will find people that will stand beside you no matter what. They are worth waiting for. I am so sorry that you had to go through those things with your best friend. Falling in love makes people do stupid things. But I am amazed that you don't seem to hold it too much against him the way you describe him. So don't apologize for holding grudges against people that deserve that. It doesn't seem as if you did this easily. You are a very loyal person and you deserve somebody that will stand beside you no matter what. Depression is not something about having the worst possible life. It is an illness. Your body doesn't give you the hormones you need to be happy. So don't be sorry for being sad! This is not your fault and nobody has any right to hold a sickness against you just because they can't understand it. I hope so much that you will find a way to have your illness treated. Therapy helps so much when you find a therapist you can trust. Medication also can help you get this first kick to get back into life.

I like that I can go anywhere in the world, and can nope the fuck out of that country by calling up my embassy and saying that the country is trampling all over my civil rights. I like that we rebuilt Europe and Japan after WWII. I like that we were a key player in turning South Korea into the economic and cultural hub that it is today. I like that we have the ability to quash many legitimate threats against our interests so easily, anywhere on Earth, even though we often overreach and do horrible and counter productive things, like signature strikes, and double taps that have heavy civilian casualties and only maybe kill a terrorist maybe, but will definitely empower and foster terrorist sentiment more than it hurts terroristic capabilities. I think this means we need to take more responsibility for our actions, not get out. Also, the best thing we could do to improve the budget would be to usher in Universal Healthcare and increase taxes to pay for that healthcare and also to turn some of those savings into general government revenue. In 2012 we spent 18% of our GDP on Healthcare (highest percentage in the world). The Neatherlands, spent 12% of their GDP on healthcare (second highest percentage in the world). Assuming we spent as much of our GDP as The Netherlands (and they make less money per capita than us) on Healthcare (freeing up 6% of our GDP for other things), and then doubled our defense budget (4.4% of our GDP in 2012) we would still save tens of billions of dollars (1.6% of our GDP) to pay down our debt, or buy chocolate covered dildos, or whatever the fuck we wanted.

Well, Mom helped find such a good deal that a bunch of people wanted to go, male and female. To get permission from parents we got two rooms (one for boys, the other for girls) and my Mom had to stay in the room with us girls to be guardian. The rooms happened to be connected by the standard 2-doors that lock from each side, both remained locked at night, but had rather flimsy looking locks. On the night of the rave, the younger girls' parents had requested they leave earlier to keep them safe. As I was the eldest girl (18yo at the time), I was to escort the girls back to the ""girl"" room before midnight where they were to go to bed (remember my Mom is in that room). I had been given the go-ahead to go back to the rave until it finished. I ended up going to the ""boy"" room with my boyfriend to make sure he was okay (he had a migraine). While I was in the ""boy"" room, this young man I'd never met before just comes in with a room key (we had had one less boy than expected, so we had an extra room key, apparently he had been given it by one of the guys staying in the room.) As I didn't know him and he didn't arrive with the friend who invited him, I told him he couldn't stay and needed to find somewhere else to sleep that night as he was not paying for the room and it was on my Mom's credit card. Guy proceeds to whine about it being late and not having a place to stay and 'couldn't [I] take pity'. I couldn't take pity as I felt a sense of obligation to the underage girls in the room next door and also to my Mother (who would probably have whooped my ass for having a 3rd party person show up overnight). Ended up having him hand over the room key, kicking him and his stuff out, then having to have a serious talk the next morning with the 'friend' who gave random-dude the key.

If it has been downvoted so many times... you think people are going to want to see it? Probably, out of intrigue if anything. Does it affect the way they feel about something? No. I come to reddit to explore others' opinions and learn what the internets are buzzing about. If the public opinion about something is negative, who the hell are you to tell us not to downvote so we know what is the crap and what is not. Please do: -This sounds like another don't, inverted to sound like a do... Reddit-- and the WORLD, relies on a sense of opinion, an array of jokes and tons of outrageous stories to thrive on.

After a few minutes we notice the parents somehow left and the kid is alone. We figure ""Ok, a few minutes, then we start questioning."" (Our store had a policy if kids were left alone, wait a few minutes then basically interrogate them). So one of the guys goes up to the kid and asks ""Where are your parents."" The kid goes ""Oh they'll be right back."" We decided while we're not baby sitters, give this kid benefit of the doubt. He's maybe 7 mind you, definitely to young to be left alone in a toy store, but not young enough to cause any trouble. Nope, we were wrong. He goes around the store, almost bullying kids, one parents notices and asks very rudely ""Where are your folks?"" again the kid responds ""Oh they'll be right back."" This went on for 20 minutes and finally my managers calls the mall security, obvious reasons. So security show up, we point out where the kid is, security take them away. Fast forward, and I'm not making this time frame up, an hour. Yes, potentially that kid would have been stuck with us for an hour. The parents show up and presumably get concerned when their son is nowhere to be seen. My manager explains how we are a toy store, not a baby sitting place for parents to drop off their kids while they shop, and had him escorted with security to the security place. We all thought the same thing ""The parents are gonna get shit on be security, the kid will throw a tantrum, embarrass everyone, and go home."" NOPE. This kid, somehow, and to this day I do not know how, suddenly appears in the store and grabs a toy. This kid looks at his folks and said ""Sorry, I had to use the bathroom."" The whole staff was floored. How the hell did he leave security's sight and end up back in the store? Regardless, the parents purchase whatever he was holding, as a treat for being so patient, then leave. No scolding, no tantrum, nothing. Not only does it baffle me that some parents have zero disregard for their own children's safety, but how they ignore the reality of the situation and pretend the kid was right. Luckily, for the remainder of the time I worked there, the family and kid never came back. Bugs me to this day.",0,0,1

Long story short, I was doing my assessment, listening to her heart, and I noticed it was slowing down, very quickly. I ran to get my instructor. Family was in the room. Instructor came in, and I listened to the heart beat slower and finally stop. Another time I was asked by the brother of a patient to terminate life support, so I did. Same thing.

c1h0yiz,"&gt; christ, why do I feel like life is about to get real boring? LOL! Your life doesn't have to be boring. Think about it, any activity that is only fun when you're wasted may not be the best quality entertainment to begin with. Don't you have any hobbies? I'm an artist, so it's easy for me to get into a project and be very focused and entertained. What do you like to do? Try things and see what catches your interest. Drugs are like credit cards. For every high (buying stuff) there is an equivalent low (paying it off). Except there is interest (having to pay back more money than you spent) because your brain gets used to the drug and has trouble being happy without it. This ""tolerance"" is what makes people need more and more to feel good. And as it goes up, they feel more and more bad when they're not high. If every adult you know ""habitually engages in drug use"" you really should try to find some people that don't. I'm not trying to demonize drug users here, but sobriety has a lot of advantages. Perks: Ability to do activities you can only do with your full brain capacity. Never having the lows of the high wearing off. The money you can spend on real stuff that is not instantly consumed and then gone. The money you'll save on medical bills for related health problems as you get older.

I wouldn't have guessed this was the comment that brought me Reddit gold. Some of you asked for details, so I'll share. This may be long, but it is an insane story. I half posted pictures to someone who called BS. At the bottom of the edit I will make a gallery of all the pictures I have. I had two primary missions will in Iraq. First was QRF/Recovery. QRF is an acronym for Quick Reaction Force (Army loves acronyms). That mission was the crazy one really. Basically if someone out in our AO was under attack needed assistance, we would run out to provide cover and, if need be, recover lost assets (think blown up trucks or worse fallen troops). We ran 172ish of those missions in around 12 months, but we were only one team of 4, so the total number of those missions is much higher for the entire unit. Our secondary mission, or as we called it our ""Dog and Pony Show"" was fun and helped relax us on our off weeks. The Army was fielding 2 new weapon systems, the M1117 ASV (Guardian) and the CROWS (Common Remotely Operated Weapon System - That may not be 100% but I am to lazy to Google and make sure). We were the unit in charge of training different units how to use the new systems over a week period. At the end of the week we drove north on MSR Tampa to an old Baath party headquarters near Samarra. This place was insanely fun. Imagine 20-30 gun trucks all unloading MK19 grenade launchers and M2 .50 cal's into a building. Plus, we were allowed to test personal weapon systems like our M16, M4, M249, or M9. It was a great way to end the training week. It was normally a cake mission. This night was different. It had just been released to the Iraqi public that day that the Air Force and drop 500lbs of freedom on Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and ended his reign as leader of AQ in Iraq. His minions were naturally upset and vowed revenge. It was the middle of the summer, so most missions were ran at night to avoid the heat. We were supposed to leave the gate at 2000 hours (8pm). I was lead vehicle commander and I also ran the commo with air support. We had just been visited by 10th Mountain Division Sergeant Major, so everyone with any rank had been asking to tag along. Normally our LT stayed in his office, where he belonged, but tonight he decided to go with us. We roll out and within 800 meters an IED is spotted. Our entire convoy hasn't even cleared the gate. It takes about 90 minutes for EOD to clear and we start to move. It was around this time the our air support radioed that they were black on fuel and wouldn't be with us any longer. That should have been the moment we said, ""Alright, pack it up. Try again tomorrow"", but we had over 20 gun trucks and no fear (we were dumb). We get the convoy clear of the gate and we have to stop again for another IED. This happens 2 more times. By the time the last IED was cleared, we were to have already returned from the mission. The last one was spotted by my gunner. My idiot LT came over the radio and said, ""Hey 22, that last one was meant for you!"" That is the thing that kills me the most about the experience. He had no idea what was coming. We are finally clear and we are finally making the turn onto Tampa. About a 2k meters ahead the IED sweep team is moving at about 2mph. They move this slow to ensure they don't miss anything. I radio back to my team leader and he leaves the decision to me to pass or stay behind the sweep as I am lead vehicle. Seeing as it is about 0200 and I am tired, my team and I decide to pass. About 2 miles up the road I see what looks like a huge rock. I was wrong. Personally, I had enough time to duck and close my eyes. At 45-50mph it is impossible to stop a huge truck, especially a 30k lbs M1117. The IED exploded directly under my gunner. I need to be honest, most of my memory from this point is spotty. I suffered a TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) some, if not most, of what I say here is what I have seen from a video taken from one of the CROWS cameras, and things that I was told from guys on the team. I remember looking behind me and only seeing fire. It was pulsing, large to small, large to small. My gunner's seat is normally 2-3 feet behind me was not visible due to smoke and fire. My radio still worked, and I could hear my team talking. ""They're good. Battleaxe 22 is still rolling."" I was trying to key my radio. The system we used made an audible beep to tell you that you were able to transmit. It seemed like forever before that beep came. When it did I explained that we were on fire and were unable to stop. Once we stopped my driver and I climbed out of the truck through our top hatch and climbed down the front of the truck. Fuel was everywhere. I noticed my platoon sergeant was stuck trying to exit the vehicle. His IBA (Body armor) was caught and he was face first in the fire. I reached in, grabbed him, lifted and yanked him from the truck. My gunner, who I hadn't been able to hear was on top of the truck. He was hurt badly. My driver and I pull him from the truck and lay him next to it. I again notice the fuel. I run to a humvee and grab an extinguisher. I was afraid the fire was not only going to ignite on the ground, but also set off the grenade and .50 cal rounds we had in the truck. I go back to my gunner and talk to him as we get the medic to come get him ready. My team leader is calling in a medivac. My gunner took the brunt of everything and ultimately lost his leg. My TBI leaves me with some memory issues and some severe migraines. After coming home I was diagnosed with hypervigilance, which is a type of PTSD. Here is the link to the album: http://imgur.com/a/RrMuQ You will see how the bomb destroyed the truck. The drive shaft is laying inside and it is bent up like pipe-cleaner.

dcd4xdq,"Not OP, but I had my gall bladder removed in February 2015 (32/F). For the six weeks or so leading up to surgery, I changed to a very low-fat diet, small meals, lots of water. It was boring and I never knew how much I love things like cheese until I gave them up for a while, but I didn't want to trigger an attack and need emergency surgery. Planned surgery is much better than emergency surgery. After surgery, I stuck to the same diet for about 5 weeks for my digestive system to learn how to not have a gall bladder. I gradually added stuff back into my diet, and gradually increased the size of my meals, and three months post-op I was good as new. The only side effect I've noticed (and I realize I've been incredibly lucky) is that I would get constipated easily. I started taking fiber supplements and now I'm just fine! For at least a few weeks after surgery, be prepared for some digestive gymnastics. Your gall bladder wasn't working, but it was at least there, and now it's not and your system is trying to learn how to work without your liver's Executive Assistant. The same day that you go home, you'll probably have pain in your right shoulder - they inject gas into your abdomen so they have room to do the operation, and after surgery, that gas migrates up your body and eventually dissipates. While it's there, though, it fucking hurts. So - walk as much as you can. This will also help digestion, but mostly it'll help dissipate the gas from surgery. Good luck! You'll be fine!",0,0,1

She wasn't a crying, sobbing little thumb-sucking mess, she had emotions but they didn't feel a need to make her a plot device. in the end, a good egalitarian film would show that women are competent without having to sacrifice their femininity. Feminism, in the end, is about how femininity is not demeaning, not to women OR to men, either.",0,0,1

ddcku0p,"&gt; Just because things get cheaper doesn't mean people are gonna throw money away on something they don't need. They could put a literal heart of gold into commercially available androids but if all it's gonna do is drive up the price then it's not really worth including. Sure, they might one day make an AI smart than humanity combined for a few dollars, why go that far when you can spend pennies and still have comparable results? A singularity level AI in a sexbot is about as useful as cat that knows calculus. You spent most of your post describing how sex bots wouldn't be useful because they would be vacant and dead and incapable of emotions. To me that implies there would be value in giving it intelligence to some degree. The superintellgence I was describing was simply because it would be no extra cost and it'd be useful to have another thing that could compute things around. Once you have atomically precise manufacturing, a pound of ANYTHING is a dollar - supercomputer or brick. &gt; People who spend money to have sex with a robot are not likely to be too concerned with an accurate human simulation. Strong disagreement here. If you can have a sexbot that can joke with you, play, be cute, and add a lot of depth to the interaction, people will want that. This isn't cell phone talk quality where people just need to understand each other - sex and companionship are deeply ingrained things in people, and if we can give that to everyone through robots it would be of incredible value to society.",0,0,1
cgsi6f4,"Yes but first I'm going to tell you why I'm against it. Some people, not all, it's makes them stupid and lazy. Examples my one buddy has been smoking for years he can't hold a steady job, has missed many good job opportunities because they have a drug test, and never wants to do anything involving leaving his house although he tells you he will right after he smokes. I have many friends who smoke, some are like this and a lot also function normally, but no matter what BS you feed yourself you know the THC is healthy for you, you're not smoking it for that you just wanna be high. What I'm getting at is it isn't as harmless as people will BS you. But the reasons I'm for it are many. First and foremost it's a better alternative than many of the highly addictive prescription drugs they prescribe. It'd stop or at least hopefully stop all those gas station alternatives, my one buddy got seriously ill from smoking some. People would also stop having criminal records, for having a bit of their favorite vice on them. And lastly it'd take the criminal element out of it.

dczsfce,"I was a UPS driver and we were taught a set of driving habits that has been extremely effective for me as far as avoiding accidents and driving safely. It's important and relevant to know that UPS has put a lot of thought and effort into developing these guidelines because their bottom line is directly effected by how safe and effective their drivers are. Additional fun fact: As a UPS driver, if you are involved in an accident they don't care who was legally at fault; they will determine wether or not it was avoidable. This is the standard to which they are held. Get t-boned by an asshole running a red light? Avoidable: you should have cleared the intersection (looking left, right, left) before entering and seen them not stopping (this habit has literally saved my life before). Someone ran into your parked truck? They will determine wether your mirror was folded in, your hazard lights were flashing, and if there was a better place you could have parked. I trust you get the idea. One of the reasons for this is that they are their own insurance company so they take this extremely seriously. So without further ado, here are the five seeing habits, the ten point commentary, and the *some* rules for backing. 1- Aim High In Steering Aim High In Steering Imaginary Target - Baseball / dartboard Centers car in traffic lane. Safe path on turns. Find a safe path well ahead. 2- Get the Big Picture Get the Big Picture How wide, how deep? what is in it? Objects and ground. Keeps you away from billboards. (Billboards refers to anything that obstructs part of your field of vision, such as large trucks, fences, awnings etc) smooth stops and turns. Buys time. Stay back and see it all 3- Keep Your Eye's Moving Keep Your Eye's Moving Move eyes: Front 2-seconds. Rear- 5-8 seconds Keeps you alive at intersections. keeps eyes ahead of the car. Scan don't stare. 4- Leave Your Self An Out Leave Your Self An Out Have and escape route. Take path of least resistance. Space on all sides, but always in front. Be prepared. Expect the unexspected. 5- Make Sure They See You Make Sure They See You Communication in traffic- horns,lights,signals. Establishs eye-to-eye contact. Don't gamble. Use your horn,lights, signals. Ten Point Commentary 1. When stopped in Traffic. When stopped in Traffic. One. When Stopped in Traffic remain one vehicle space between you and the vehicle ahead in fron of you. Leave your self an out. 2. Starting up at intersection Starting up at intersection Two. Look left - right - Check Mirrors. Keep your eyes moving. 3. Count ONE- TWO THREE after vehicle ahead has started to move, or when the light changes to green. Count ONE- TWO THREE after vehicle ahead has started to move, or when the light changes to green. Leave your self an out. 4. Four to Six seconds following distance (under 50km/h) Six to Eight seconds following distance (over 50km/h) Four to Six seconds following distance under 50km/h Six to Eight seconds following distance over 50km/h The distance is to be adjusted when the road, traffic, and weather conditions change. Leave your self an out. 5. Five to Eight seconds - Check Mirrors. Five to Eight seconds - Check Mirrors. Never check mirror to mirror when driving. After mirror check- back to front. Keep your eyes moving. 6. Scan steering wheels. Scan steering wheels. Look for activity around in other vehicles signals, exhaust, steering tire moved out, any shadows inside the vehicle. A ball could indicate small children. Get the big picture. 7. Stale green light. Stale green light. A stale green light in one that you did not see change or has been green for while. Determine a decision point to make a safe stop or proceed through the intersection safely. Get the big picture. 8. Eight to TWELVE seconds eye-lead time. Eight to TWELVE seconds eye-lead time. This is the area that you are looking to take your vehicle towards travel path. The 8-12 seconds stay the same but the distance changes due to your travelling speed. Aim high in steering. 9. Pulling from the curb. Complete the THREE L's. 1. Left signal. 2. Left mirror. 3. Left shoulder. Look over left shoulder to check blind spot, then pull away. Get the big picture. 10. Eye contact. It is imperative that you get their attention. Use horns, lights, signals. Avoid a dangerous situation. Make sure they see you. *Some* rules for backing (I don't have the actual flash card for this and can't figure out how many official rules there are and what the order is so here's a bunch) 1. Don't back unless absolutely necessary. 2. If you have to back then back first. (The purpose of this is so you can be sure that your backing area is clear since you can look as you pull up. If you wait to back until you get back in the vehicle conditions could have changed such as a child walking behind vehicle) 3. Before and during backing, scan the areas your vehicle will be approaching. 4. Back strait if possible. Avoid blind-side backing (your vehicle obstructs your field of view) 5. Stay out of driveways and be aware of children in residential areas 6. Tap your horn continuously to signal your intentions. (Super annoying to bystanders but effective nonetheless) 7. Use the rear-view camera monitor as a third mirror. (Or for people not driving a UPS package car: Use your rear view mirror. It's amazing to me how many people don't do this.)

Granted that most people eat empty carbs with no value such as processed sucrose or white rice, but things like brown rice and whole-grain breads are an absolute essential part of a healthy persons diet if they are indeed active and need fast and easy to metabolize energy to function at a high capacity level of fitness. Sometimes even non-nutrient dense carbs can be useful for people who have a high-energy need such as maraton runners or an even better example: iron-man competitors.

dfa9xpw,"My grandparents' home was built at the turn of the 20th century as a servants' house for the mansion next door. I'm unsure exactly of the list of owners, but know my gram and granddad bought it in the mid-1950's. She still lives there, but granddad passed away in 2003, about 1-1/2 before this story takes place. When I was a teenager, whenever my gram would go out of town, she'd ask if I wanted to housesit. For a multitude of reasons, I'd always leap at the offer, naturally. From time to time, she'd let my best friend stay there with me. We were incredibly straight-laced kids, no booze or drugs of any kind for us, which helped her be more comfortable with letting us stay. On the flip side, it also makes this situation all the more difficult to explain away. On this occasion, we were doing our typical ""sleepover"" routine, playing cards, eating snacks, and had a rented movie on the tv as background noise. We're chatting away about whatever, when she tells me to be quiet. I laugh it off, as we're both big horror movie nuts, and figure she was just trying to get a rise out of me. To placate her, we pause the movie and listen. Nothing. We continue talking and shortly after, we both hear the stairs creak as if someone is sneaking down them. I pause the movie again; we both then hear 2 more creaks, followed by a man's voice saying ""hello?"" We both lose our shit and literally run right out the front door. She thankfully had a cell phone at the time (neither of us were old enough to drive), which I used to call my mother and we demand that she come down and help us clear the house, otherwise we weren't going back in. She showed up within about half an hour and walked through the house for us, after chastising us for not calling the police if we were that certain someone was there. She found no one, of course, and I've never experienced anything abnormal there since. Thinking back to this experience still gives me major chills though.",0,0,1

Another thing that helps me is just waking up early and at some point in the day working out or exercising, I am an avid rock climber so that is my workout.

dgbagbm,"Recently in a relationship, so here are the things I miss: 1) When you're single, nights out are much more exciting. There is the possibility of meeting someone incredible, opportunities abound-- the second you're in a relationship there is no one to meet-- all the little romances you could have are now inappropriate or a violation of obligation. 2) Not having to go to stupid couple events. Many other couples are unstable, crazy, and desperately in need of validation, so they have these couples events where they invite a whole bunch of other couples to use as a crutch or evidence that they are ""okay"". They usually don't invite single people, so you don't have to make excuses to avoid these. 3) Finances (men). As a guy, relationships are more expensive than being single, largely because of the couples events, and because keeping dating interesting requires doing different things-- and things are pretty expensive. I don't know what it's like for women, but I would imagine it's much less expensive to be in a relationship. 4) Crazy hot sex with different people. Sex can become very routine with the same person and variety is fun. 5) Less routinized life. As above, but for activities. Dating new people can broaden your world and you cannot connect the same way when you're not single. 6) Networking opportunities. If you're savvy, even if you aren't romantically interested you can still leverage relationships with the opposite sex and are in a better position to do it when you're single. 7) Time. Relationships take up a lot of time. You spend your time on one person rather than divisible as you might like. 8) Freedom.

Emily just smiles while he makes it clear that he has been secretly traveling to New York once a month for years to meet her. He says they met in elementary school and had made a pact to meet up again, now that she could drive. Emily shifts uncomfortably. He says his parents disapprove of her. He says he needs $25. I stare at him in wonder, wondering why he needed to make all that up so he could borrow some money. I left him with $10 that he never paid back. Never found out the true story about that girl.",0,0,1

The planner didnt know anyone was vegan and he didnt even mark it when he sent the email out asking if anyone had any dietary restrictions. So then he had to see if the catering company had vegan options. They did, but the options werent good enough because there was more regular food then vegan food. When he was told they werent getting equal amounts of vegan/non-vegan food for what was essentially one guy and his gf vs 70 other people any their +1s he tried to throw a tantrum and go over the planners head to HR. HR basically told him accomodations had been made, tough titty if he didnt like them he also was not required to go and could bring his own food if he liked.

c1grb5g,"1. Pay off your debt 2. Max out tax savings plans (ie 401k) 3. Open a brokerage account 4. Place the 3K into a money market fund. This is the ""savings account"" savvy investors use - safe, higher interest and easy to get money back from when you need it. 5. Figure out what you need for an emergency fund (typically 3-6 months basic living expenses). That amount NEVER leaves your money market fund unless it's an actual fucking emergency. Not for a new couch, not for a down payment. Nothing. 6. The remainder is actually what you have to invest with. It's not a lot at this point (if any). Put that initially with a mutual fund type called an ""index fund"". Your broker will not push this because they don't make a lot of money off them. But they will know what it is and if you ask they will agree it's the best choice just starting out. This gets you practice investing without the risk associated with most other choices. 7. Anything more complicated or aggressive than this *requires* talking to a financial planner. Not the same one who is selling you the investment. That's a salesperson, regardless of what their business card says. Some other rules of thumb: * Don't invest in the ""pure"" stock market with less than 30K - brokerage fees will kill you. There are some exceptions to this, but start with this idea. For penny stocks, this rule is even more important. * One exception is stock purchase plans through your company - almost always a good deal. Max them out unless your company is heading for a tailspin. * Never put all your eggs in one basket. Talk to a financial adviser about the mix that's right for you, but your portfolio should be a mix of different types of investments from different sectors as soon as it's large enough to do so. Until then, stay on the safe side. Obviously, this is a highly simplified plan, but it should start you off. As always, consult a reputable financial planner before making any kind of serious investing decision. Not some Redditor.

We travel FORWARD in time daily. Time travel to the future is a reality, and anyone can do it now if we have enough money and rocket fuel. Exactly as this OP and some of its threads discuss. Nothing unscientific or untestable about that. It fills the criteria of the original question and is 100% practical. Backwards time travel, FTL travel, etc are simple enough, novel computational concepts that we can use in a practical sense to figure out real, measurable problems. Trying to hypothesize from the perspective of an object moving backwards through time or FTL is like trying to explain what's happening to light inside a black hole. We're only able to speculate as well as our physics models currently allow, and they just don't account for these scenarios yet. ""a few hack sci-fi writers"" are not the people doing the speculating. Hawking, Sagan, and Feynman all openly hypothesized about the practical consequences of various models. Sci Fi writers borrow from them. It's not junk science or pseudointellectualism-- it's real, insightful thought. You can't dismiss it just because most people are able to relate to these concepts through silly movie themes like Marty MacFly's fading polaroids.

It began with painfully ignorant 'taco tuesday' denigrrative attempts to 'showcase other cultures'. When those trainings began, if you asked the class to do an identity exercise, people would write down archetypal racial identities that basically matched their census answer. Two decades later, these answers are universally more *nuanced*. Remember that whites-only communities and early census forms simply had ""white"" and ""other"", then ""white"", ""asian"" and ""black"". The demographic that would have simply been 'black' in the early 90s includes other multi-racial heritages, even as the white students are embracing ancestors who were hidden, shamed and covered up 90 years ago. Example is elizabeth warren's claim to native american heritage, covered up by her family in all records for three generations and now the identities are having their 'day in the sun'. Multi-racial is now the fastest growing racial identity, and helms and other reseachers have explored how boundary-spanning identity development differs from simply 'white' or 'minority' racial identity.

cyyibxq,"Considering some of the responses, a [Serious] tag would've helped but no biggie! I think the biggest catalyst was when my parents divorced. Sure, religious folk could say they weren't faithful in their religion and their union wasn't solidly built around love for Jesus, or that they simply weren't compatible. And of course, reality being as it is, they simply weren't compatible; the problem was that in the context of me being very religious at the time, it didn't make sense. I saw it as a trial that God was putting me through to test my faith, because that's what I was raised to believe: that the low points in my life were tests that were given to me because I could handle it. But why? Why was I being tested that way? What did being on verge of having a broken, emotionally and financially destitute family for many years to come have anything to do with testing my faith? Is he such a jealous god that he had to strip me of my family's wholesomeness and my seeming happiness from having a family that's together, just to see if I still love him afterwards? It tore me up inside because, what sort of deity that revolves around the theme of love and acceptance no matter who you are and where you've come from will just let bad things happen to me, just to test my faith? As if devoting much of my youth, time, and effort to try to live by his example wasn't enough, despite that all it took to find myself in Heaven was to basically be selfless and good, and accept him as my personal savior? It just made more sense thinking about this in real terms: my dad was a cheater, and my mom found out. Simple facts. There wasn't a spiritual trial to undergo, and there simply wasn't more to it than the fact that my dad was a liar with next to no morals or standards of good fatherly behavior. ***************************** It also didn't help that every pastor I've ever had growing up had told me different things about the same topics: No one else in any other religion or race, not even Jews, can't go to Heaven because they're not Presbyterian Christians (*despite the fact that the Jewish were the chosen people according to the same book both religions read*); Yes, you must preach the word of god to everyone you know (*which resulted in losing some friends*); No, you can't be in a relationship or have sex; Yes you can be in a relationship, but behave because God is watching; Masturbation is a sin; the list goes on. I've been in a few relationships, had sex, and romped with Handgela for as long as I can remember and I'm still here. No one was ever consistent with much, and they were more quick to try to police small, petty things like cursing than to answer questions that even remotely tested the dogmatic belief that was Christianity. And frankly, when your church leaders hire a convicted sex offender to guide and be in charge of kids between the ages of 10 to 16, or hire someone who slips a roofie into an underage girl's drink, and when the same leaders are caught in a scandal of stealing money from offering baskets for years and drive Jaguars while telling everyone to be humble and donate more to the church, there's not much argument you can make that doesn't trod blatantly around ""But they're not real Christians, REAL Christians wouldn't do that!"" Ahh, but they were Christians. They accepted Christ into their lives, did they not? What makes them different from me in terms of having that status as a religious person? Even with the argument that they were the ""bad apples"" of the group. they're equal on the follower-of-Christ plane; they just chose poorly to indulge in their selfish endeavors. ******************************* Apologies for the heat!

I am a Vietnam veteran and I always remember the many great men who never came home. I know I am very lucky to have survived and I always remind myself no matter the problems I have now I have faced worse over there. I came from poverty and although I am still struggling financially I have always paid my rent/mortgage on time, put food on the table, and helped pay for my kids going to college. My kids are all doing great and so are my grand kids. Not everyone can say that. I have got to work very fun construction jobs for the better part of 40 years. How many people can say they accidentally found their dream job and got to thoroughly enjoy it for 40 years? Not many. I think of how I have been married to the most beautiful woman in the world for 46 years. How weve weathered it all and how despite having been romantically involved for 50+ years I still get butterflies in my stomach like a giddy 12 year old who sees his crush whenever I see her. How many people can say they have found that kind of love? I think of my amazing dogs, great friends, not perfect but still ok financial situation, my house, extended family etc. Now I am going to predict you are a younger man/ woman who hasnt lived as long as I have and havent done as much. So you may not have all these accomplishments/ experiences to look back on quite yet. But just take a moment to appreciate what you have right now. Think to yourself, could my situation be worse? Do I, despite my struggles, still have a home, internet, family that loves me (please forgive me if I am not describing your situation right Im just improvising here)? And most importantly, just remember, YOU have the power to change your situation. You control your own destiny, and although sometimes things will be difficult, past demons will haunt you, YOU can define yourself. Do not let anyone or anything else do that. Now, again, I dont know your situation. You may have depression or maybe your just at a bad point in your life but either way I hope my comment helped somehow. Remember the past, learn from it, but dont let it define you. Appreciate what you have now in the present but also constructively analyze for what you dont have thats making you sad, and then use your current tools to plan for the future so you can get the happiness you desire.

Well, except for the windshield wiper fluid... hold it, how in the world does a snake talk? Are you real? Are you some sort of Disney animation?"" ""No,"" says the snake, ""I'm real. As real as you or anyone is, anyway. I didn't give you a drink. I bit you. That's how it works - it's what I do. I bite. I don't have hands to give you a drink, even if I had water just sitting around here."" The man sat stunned for a minute. Here he was, sitting in the middle of the desert on some strange stone that should be hot but wasn't, talking to a snake that could talk back and had just bitten him. And he felt better. Not great - he was still starving and exhausted, but much better - he was no longer thirsty. He had started to sweat again, but only slightly. He felt hot, in this sun, but it was starting to get lower in the sky, and the cool stone beneath him was a relief he could notice now that he was no longer dying of thirst. ""I might suggest that we take care of that methanol you now have in your system with the next request,"" continued the snake. ""I can guess why you drank it, but I'm not sure how much you drank, or how much methanol was left in the wiper fluid. That stuff is nasty. It'll make you go blind in a day or two, if you drank enough of it."" ""Ummm, n-next request?"" said the man. He put his hand back on his hurting shoulder and backed away from the snake a little. ""That's the way it works. If you like, that is,"" explained the snake. ""You get three requests. Call them wishes, if you wish."" The snake grinned at his own joke, and the man drew back a little further from the show of fangs. ""But there are rules,"" the snake continued. ""The first request is free. The second requires an agreement of secrecy. The third requires the binding of responsibility."" The snake looks at the man seriously. ""By the way,"" the snake says suddenly, ""my name is Nathan. Old Nathan, Samuel used to call me. He gave me the name. Before that, most of the Bound used to just call me 'Snake'. But that got old, and Samuel wouldn't stand for it. He said that anything that could talk needed a name. He was big into names. You can call me Nate, if you wish."" Again, the snake grinned. ""Sorry if I don't offer to shake, but I think you can understand - my shake sounds somewhat threatening."" The snake give his rattle a little shake. ""Umm, my name is Jack,"" said the man, trying to absorb all of this. ""Jack Samson. ""Can I ask you a question?"" Jack says suddenly. ""What happened to the poison...umm, in your bite. Why aren't I dying now? How did you do that? What do you mean by that's how you work?"" ""That's more than one question,"" grins Nate. ""But I'll still try to answer all of them. First, yes, you can ask me a question."" The snake's grin gets wider. ""Second, the poison is in you. It changed you. You now no longer need to drink. That's what you asked for. Or, well, technically, you asked to not be thirsty any more - but 'any more' is such a vague term. I decided to make it permanent - now, as long as you live, you shouldn't need to drink much at all. Your body will conserve water very efficiently. You should be able to get enough just from the food you eat - much like a creature of the desert. You've been changed. ""For the third question,"" Nate continues, ""you are still dying. Besides the effects of that methanol in your system, you're a man - and men are mortal. In your current state, I give you no more than about another 50 years. Assuming you get out of this desert, alive, that is."" Nate seemed vastly amused at his own humor, and continued his wide grin. ""As for the fourth question,"" Nate said, looking more serious as far as Jack could tell, as Jack was just now working on his ability to read talking-snake emotions from snake facial features, ""first you have to agree to make a second request and become bound by the secrecy, or I can't tell you."" ""Wait,"" joked Jack, ""isn't this where you say you could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?"" ""I thought that was implied."" Nate continued to look serious. ""Ummm...yeah."" Jack leaned back a little as he remembered again that he was talking to a fifteen foot poisonous reptile with a reputation for having a nasty temper. ""So, what is this 'Bound by Secrecy' stuff, and can you really stop the effects of the methanol?"" Jack thought for a second. ""And, what do you mean methanol, anyway? I thought these days they use ethanol in wiper fluid, and just denature it?"" ""They may, I don't really know,"" said Nate. ""I haven't gotten out in a while. Maybe they do. All I know is that I smell methanol on your breath and on that bottle in your pocket. And the blue color of the liquid when you pulled it out to drink some let me guess that it was wiper fluid. I assume that they still color wiper fluid blue?"" ""Yeah, they do,"" said Jack. ""I figured,"" replied Nate. ""As for being bound by secrecy - with the fulfillment of your next request, you will be bound to say nothing about me, this place, or any of the information I will tell you after that, when you decide to go back out to your kind. You won't be allowed to talk about me, write about me, use sign language, charades, or even act in a way that will lead someone to guess correctly about me. You'll be bound to secrecy. Of course, I'll also ask you to promise not to give me away, and as I'm guessing that you're a man of your word, you'll never test the binding anyway, so you won't notice."" Nate said the last part with utter confidence. Jack, who had always prided himself on being a man of his word, felt a little nervous at this. ""Ummm, hey, Nate, who are you? How did you know that? Are you, umm, omniscient, or something?"" Well, Jack,"" said Nate sadly, ""I can't tell you that, unless you make the second request."" Nate looked away for a minute, then looked back. ""Umm, well, ok,"" said Jack, ""what is this about a second request? What can I ask for? Are you allowed to tell me that?"" ""Sure!"" said Nate, brightening. ""You're allowed to ask for changes. Changes to yourself. They're like wishes, but they can only affect you. Oh, and before you ask, I can't give you immortality. Or omniscience. Or omnipresence, for that matter. Though I might be able to make you gaseous and yet remain alive, and then you could spread through the atmosphere and sort of be omnipresent. But what good would that be - you still wouldn't be omniscient and thus still could only focus on one thing at a time. Not very useful, at least in my opinion."" Nate stopped when he realized that Jack was staring at him. ""Well, anyway,"" continued Nate, ""I'd probably suggest giving you permanent good health. It would negate the methanol now in your system, you'd be immune to most poisons and diseases, and you'd tend to live a very long time, barring accident, of course. And you'll even have a tendency to recover from accidents well. It always seemed like a good choice for a request to me.""",0,0,1

She didn't get me help or anything until my school found out I had blades and laxatives in my bag, I went to a private school so naturally I was suspended until a doctor ensured I was mentally stable and my parents were put on a black list and they blamed me for it all. But then they were forced to take me to headspace. Anyway long story short, 7 years down the track I haven't achieved much in the ways of treatment. I have borderline personality disorder with offset of social anxiety, depression, eating disorders and PTSD. Australia, Adelaide in particular sucks for public mental health treatment. I was kicked out at 15 after my mum moved me to my dads in hope it would help when dad only made it worse, with verbal and physical abuse plus the new enviroment, school and everything. So I never finished school and last year I became too socially anxious to work, I lost my job and I'm trained in hospitality so there's little chance I'd get employment until I get better. But the good news is I am now 1 year self harm free!!! It was a long long journey but this is the furthest I've come. I have a good feeling about this year and welfare have approved sick pay which will allow me to study and focus on improving my health.

Instead of telling me not to do it, she should've taken me to a doctor. My mum was pretty busy and focused on her new family with my stepdad, so some mum and daughter time would've been great. Now that I think about it, she never taught me to shave, cook, do my make up or even clean. We didn't go to the movies or paint each other's nails or anything like that.

As a working class individual, I am pretty surprised you feel Trump is better for you than Bernie. There's this idea that Trump doesn't represent the wealthy elite (he does) and this idea that Bernie only represents minorities. Bernie was fucking scary to me because he represented the poor. He wanted to get rid of all the nice entitlements that the rich have built into the system (capital gains, estate tax thresholds, etc) and wanted to give everyone free healthcare and college education at the cost to the top 10%. No empty promises about coal and factory jobs because those are gone for good and it's not the liberal elite that took them from anyone. It was companies like Trump's who sent all labor overseas because it was infinitely cheaper, and because American consumers (the blame isn't just with the corporation's) wanted cheaper goods.

The mother got sick and died just a few days after giving birth (my poor kitty) so i took them on as orphans. We use a heating pad under some soft sheets for them to stay warm. They love it but you have ot make sure the heating pad has a very low setting and monitor it at first to make sure it will not get too hot for them. They do take a few days to get used to the bottle. it helps to have an little ritual associated with the feeding for them to get used to. since they squirm all over the place, we wrap them in a small towel and hold them all bundled up in it when feeding them. we also put a tiny dab of the milk on the towel and use the same one every time. this makes it so they automatically associate the towel and getting wrapped in it with food time and are ready for it when it comes. They only seem to need a very small amount periodically throughout the day. oh, and i assume you are already aware, but just in case, it is very important to use the milk they sell especially for kittens. regular cows milk will not due. One of the difficult parts is cleaning them. normally, the mother cleans them constantly and (eww!) licks their bottoms in order to stimulate them to defecate. So, they will inevitably be covered in some of the most smelly poo one can imagine every morning and when you try to clean off their little bottoms with a warm wet rag, they will proceed to poo even more.

It's excusable because you know them and it's not all too rude. While in the group, own the conversation, but hot potato it. By that I mean imagine you're selling something to a group of investors. During the presentation you listen to everyone because they might buy it. That's what you do. Own the conversation but ask people their opinions on it. This works on numerous levels. One, it shows youre confident. Two, it shows you listen to other people's opinions and youre open to discussion. In this scenario you ask the person your interested in. Find some common ground and then turn that group conversation into a conversation between you to. Read the scene, is she interested back? Body language comes in handy for this. But don't do anything yet, only compliment them once, a nice small semi-ambiguous compliment. Once you guys get to know each other more and you think it's okay, that they have the feeling aswell you can touch them. Base this off of how she took the compliment. Rub your hand against their arm if they get close. If she sits closely next to you then put your arm behind her. You'll know when it's appropriate to do, you get a feeling. If you can't do that because you're scared then no big deal. You can just ask for their number and continue talking that way, asking for someone's number isnt an obvious hey I'm interested in you. It can either mean that or that you're a cool person. If someone invites you somewhere like a party that means they want to spend time with you. I had a girl interested in me have her friend who I wasn't close to invite me to a party. The moment I saw the girl that was interested in me I immediately started talking to her and then we slowly got into a more private but still open area. We were sitting it the walk through room so people walking by were common. I did this because even if they are interested in you. You shouldn't immediate seclude yourselves unless it's obvious, in my opinion it looks kind of sketchy. During that we talked right across from each other and I casually put my hand on her arm if we were both resting it on the table. Thats another thing. Don't rest your hand on a woman's leg unless it's obvious she has feelings like that, always go for the arm or hand. It's a light gesture that you're interested in them. Let's say you're at a bar. I don't have much experience in this. The last bar I went to I went with a friend and I met two girls that were interested in me since they met me. I'm awkward at bars, I don't like them as much as parties. That is until I get a few shots in me. For this you have to spend money. I buy people next to me shots, I talk to anyone. But when someone is interested in you at a bar they make in kind of obvious. They keep looking at you, hopefully you have a friend that can wing man/woman you, have them approach or if they're good they will on their own. Buy them a drink. Bars are normally loud, if someone is interested in you instead of trying to talk over the music they lean in and talk into your ear. Now this is when you should lightly grab there arm. This can mean three things. You like them or your drunk and holding onto them/pulling them closer to hear. See how they react to that, again, body language. If it's positive then but them a drink and find a more quiet place to talk, again, not too private. During this do the hand thing again. They rest their hand on the bar? Put yours on the bar and gradually move into grab theirs. Is it a hook up? Do the switch. Say your left arm is on the bar with theirs. With the left grab your drink. With your right hand grab their right hand, I'd imagine it's hanging by their side if they're sitting like a normal person. That's closer to the thigh. Now only do this if you know they have that feeling aswell. Take your right hand away from theirs and grab their knee. If they allow this get to know more about them, talk into their ear more, but don't lean in too far like a dunce. When you think it's time casually say ""Hey, do you want to go somewhere else?"" If they say yes then call an Uber, I don't care if you think you're sober enough to drive, you consumed alcohol. Now you're at your house with her? Go at it, again if she still wants to. Just because shes at your house doesnt mean she wants sex. People can change their mind in a heart beat. Always always always take her into consideration. Don't outright make it obvious, but read her. Whether this is for a hook up, a full blown relationship, or a FWB. Always read the situation if she is comfortable, if she isn't then pull back a little or all the way. The worst thing that is going to happen is they say no. And when they say no, don't berate them. Just be like alright, I hope you have a good night.",0,0,1

My story is not intended to minimize or play on the horrors they are experiencing. In June 2005, I was solo backpacking Europe. I was in London and had an early morning flight to Rome. I was on the tube in a car by myself around midnight-1am. Suddenly, the door between cars opened and 3 Middle Eastern men wearing coats and backpacks step inside my car. They all stared at me then got into a huddle and whispered with a few more glances in my direction. I became hyper aware of being a petite female alone, but, they thankfully walked to the next car. As I was processing how weird that was, it occurred to me that it wouldn't take much to put something in a backpack and disable the train and then I had another thought that they almost seemed to be casing it. I realized I was being really racist and paranoid because these men had every right to be there, and even though I had crazy bad vibes from them, it was probably all in my head. But it just felt weird. I wondered if I should say something to someone but I figured it's not illegal to walk between train cars and stare menacingly at girls then keep walking. I get on my plane to Rome a few hours later and when I arrived, I turned on my phone and found a ton of missed calls making sure that I was safe. There were multiple explosions in the London Underground that morning. One was on the same line I was on and when the men entered my car, we were coming up to one of the stations that was hit. Most likely, I'm a paranoid racist, but I still wonder if I saw some sort of last minute trial run.

I exclusively date men (and so far in life, cis men). But within that, I don't have a separate term for my heterosexuality that specifies that I like traditionally American-masculine men. Just like my friend who dates super thin, Bowie types doesn't have a specific term that outlines her need for men who don't traditionally conform to gender roles. Personally, I think all the terms beyond hetero/homo/pansexual are splitting hairs. There is what you are capable of being sexually attracted to, which I think sexuality is. Then there are preferences/turn ons/turn offs within that spectrum. I don't think those need to be termed sexualities.",0,0,1

Also, there were a few lights on, which was weird because they were on a cruise for the week. To be honest, I didn't think much of it at first; I just figured it was the old lady on the opposite side of them who they usually had come in and feed their cats while they were away. Then I hear two more loud thuds--it sounded like someone was holding a WWE match in their living room. What really tipped me off that something was wrong was that the lights in one of the upstairs bedrooms kept going on for a few seconds, then off for a few seconds, then off and on again. So I walk over and knock on the door. No answer. I stand there for a bit and pound. No answer. I wanted to ask the old lady on the other side if she had any idea what was going on/make sure someone wasn't in the house throwing her again the walls or something. So I walk over to her house and knock on her door. It figures; there's no answer, which is slightly strange because she only leaves her house like once every couple of weeks when her kids take her out. But at this point, I'm in full blown panic mode. So I run back to my house and get my copy of the key for the old lady's house (her daughter gave it to me so I could get in in case she ever fell or ya know...died). I go inside the old lady's house and start calling her name to no avail. I run down the hall and check her rooms real quick to see if she's home. No one. So I see a key on her kitchen counter and (correctly) assume that it's the key for the neighbors who are away. I grab it and run over to their house--in hindsight, this is probably where I went wrong. So I go into their house. First thing I notice is the closet next to the front door is open. I walk into the kitchen. A bunch of the cabinets are open with some of the food on the counters and the floor. The curtains on the window above the sink are on the floor, so I'm all kinds of fucked up. Then I hear a loud crash from the second floor. I sneak upstairs. All the lights are off except one bedroom light (the one that kept going on and off earlier), and the door to that bedroom is closed. I hear another crash. It sounds like someone is throwing the dressers against the wall or something. I'm not really sure what I'm going to do at this point, but I creep up to the closed door. I hear the old lady's voice on the other side. She opens the door. She gets on the floor. Everybody walk the dinosaur.",0,0,1

But there's more to the wall than the wall. You'll also need people patrolling it to make sure people don't climb over or tunnel under.

I was young and innocent. Well when I was a kid, my dad was my superhero. I looked up to him and everything. I wanted to be just like him. As I got older I started seeing the things he was doing. He began to not pay attention to me anymore. I would always ask to hang out with him but he would always be busy, or always forget that we had plans. A good way to put it was that I felt he didn't have enough time to love me. And it made me feel shitty. ""Why does my dad not want to hang out with me? Whats wrong with me?"" are things that went through my head for YEARS. Those feelings stuck with me till I was about 20 when I got passed it. Him hanging out with his friends was more important than seeing me and it hurt, so much. He was too busy doing cocaine. Everynight I would hear yelling between my parents but I had no idea what they were yelling about when I was young. When I got older I found out that it was because my dad would constantly cheat on my mom. Some were with my mom's friends. And regardless of the things my dad was doing, even though logically I realized that it was his problem, I just couldn't get it out of my head that I was the problem. It really hurts when you think your dad doesn't love you. After a lot of therapy I'm good now. I know that he did/does love me but just didn't know how to show it. He had a problem and it was his problem. He finally got better maybe about 6 or so years ago. we have a good relationship again but it took a lot to get there.

I am far better off with it than many people still trying medication and therapy that I know of, so isn't it reasonable to believe that everyone is capable of dealing with their depression on their own? If you are a non-productive person, of your own volition, you better believe that nobody is going to appreciate you. If you don't starve yourself from lack of food because you refuse to take help from other people and can't be bothered to get a job and make enough money to feed yourself, no one will have a problem with that. If you take that money from other people, leech off of the things that they have actually worked to achieve, they will not appreciate you in any way, shape, or form.

Are you seriously telling me that marketing is a selfless act for the benefit of the consumer? What crack are you smoking? &gt; What's unfortunate is when you are forced to view ads that are for NOTHING you'd ever buy. My feeling is that ads are equally undesirable. If I want to buy something, I will research it and buy it. I don't need people pushing it in my face trying to create a need. It is a waste of my time in the case of TV ads, a waste of screen realestate in the case of the web, and an eyesore in the case of billboards. I block it, skip it, and ignore it on those ground alone. I don't care if it is targeted. I don't want to be bothered, period. &gt; So you'd rather the internet find new revenue sources? Honestly, I dont' mind if the internet stays the way it is as long as I have effective tools at my disposal such as Adblock Plus to filter the content to my liking. But if too many people blocked ads, then yeah, I guess they'd have to find new sources of revenue. But really, it isn't my problem. &gt; Or just avoid being too intrusive? I'll block it all anyway. There's no acceptable level. &gt; Like i described above, you are inevitably going to be annoyed by ads so long as they aren't for products you want. All ads that present themselves when I am not looking for them annoy me with one exception: movie previews. Though I do get annoyed when DVDs dont' let me skip them when I've seen them already. That pisses me off to no end. &gt; (We're a ""want it now"" population, so we're not down with waiting for ads, etc) I don't think it has to do with ""wanting it now."" They're just distracting.

My Dad always had a big interest in ancient culture and archeology what is quite fascinating when you are young. This lead to the fact that I read Ancient Greek stories quite early. Their polytheistic views are quite entertaining and made my ask how they came up with them. Turns out they are largely inspired by even older cultures like ancient Egypt's culture and religion(s). From there on I started to realize that religions developed over time and often have a lot in common. You can see how older religions inspired and influenced younger ones. Given this realization it seems to be more rational to assume that every religion is something that was developed by humans over time. So how can one of them be true while other are not? I read quite a lot of religious texts from different epochs and I learned a lot of good moral ideas by doing so. I could never believe in one (or two or many) gods though because it doesn't add up. Further I regard many institutionalizations of religions harmful and as a body of control that we should get rid of. The only place for religion in modern society should by to transport good values by using great stories that's it. Nevertheless I'm not an atheist in the redditors sense who has to tell everyone how stupid religions are. My girlfriend is catholic and I have the deepest respect for that. It's not my business what she believes in as long as she accepts that I think different.

ddv5ljn,"My husband hasn't spoken to his parents since a huge fiasco that started with his father punching me in the face. My husband and father got in a fistfight. Cops were involved, and my inlaws committed perjury in court, accused us of breaking in (we had a key and were invited), and tried to talk the DA into dropping the assault charges on my father in law in favor of prosecuting -me- for 'attempted murder'. My mother in law called my husband 237 times in one day, texted him an obscene amount of insane messages, and wrote him a three page letter about how he needed to divorce me because I was going to murder him someday. To top it off, the monster-in-law started harrassing our friends that she could find numbers for, to the point that they had to change their numbers, and one of them even -moved-. The last time we heard from them was a few years ago, when my father in law ran into a girl he knew we used to hang out with all the time, and asked her to tell my husband that his mother had died. He had a party when he was told. -My- family, on the other hand, (excepting one uncle that I'm sad I can't find contact info for) is a group of the most conniving, backstabbing people you'd ever find. Not perjury material, but close. When my mother died, they came to see her in the hospital, and the majority of the conversation had to do with how horrible of a job I must have been doing taking care of her, because I hadn't super-hero'ed away her brain cancer. When my husband and I moved to California to try and find work, and help take care of my grandmother, who had severe late-stage dementia and alzheimers, the family who was supposed to be also caring for her disappeared, only showing up once a week or so to talk to Grandma about their various problems. When we got there, her living situation was so poor, had I not been moving in, I would have called elder services. She thought the water in her house wasn't drinkable, that her shower didn't work (so she didn't think she could bathe) her nails were ridiculously long, her hair hadn't been cared for, and they had, concerned that she may try to drive, disconnected the battery to her truck. She lived on a 25 acre property, by herself, with no nearby helpers, and someone called her once an evening to make sure she was still okay. In the first few months that we were there, my husband and I had to lock the door to the house we were in (there were two on the property) because she would come down at all times of the day and night and attempt to clean, which resulted in things like half our food being thrown away, us digging half our belongings that she didn't recognize out of the trash, and one of the most terrifying instances, when we were working on the septic tank, she -suddenly- showed up out of nowhere and almost walked into the hole to the tank. I was unable to find work there, and we had to move back to the city, and less than 2 months later, I got a text message that she had passed away. When I asked what happened, I was told that 'she just couldn't take it anymore', which, knowing even though they had disconnected her truck battery, they hadn't removed the guns from her house, I asked my aunt if she had commited suicide. She told me that I aught to be happy I was in a different state, because if I had had the gall to ask that to her face, she would have 'knocked my head off'. I get that grief makes people angry, but considering everything else, I'd had enough, and two out of the three people I -actually- liked out of my family was dead, so I didn't really see the point of putting up with it anymore. I haven't even looked them up online in almost 6 years.",0,0,1

cgtwetg,"Insurance adjuster here: Read your policy BEFORE you file a claim. I won't have to be ""the dick that didn't pay your claim"" if it's something not covered. Also, if you suffer some sort of loss (barring catastrophic losses for property or destroyed cars), get an estimate before filing the claim. At that point you can decide whether it's worth pursuing a claim. We know there are plenty of ways body shops/contractors get you around paying your deductible. Honestly, we don't really care. We just want to be done with the claim ourselves. One less person to return calls/emails to. Regarding auto claims, you may want to do some math before going with that shop that will save you that $500 Collision deductible. For example, in NC with the company I work with, if an auto claim exceeds $1,800 you get 1 insurance point against you. $1800-$2999 is 2 points. Over $3k is 3 points. These points follow you for THREE years and cause your premium to rise. So if you suffer a legit $1700 loss and the body shop decides to write it up as $2,200 to save you a $500 deductible, there may be greater repercussions. Obviously each scenario is different given individual's claim history, just saying, do some math, think about it. Lastly, BE NICE to your adjuster. Claim scenarios can generate a lot of grey area as to whether or not things can be covered. This gives us a lot of leeway. Like a lot of customer service jobs, we can make things easy for you or be difficult as hell depending on how you treat us.",0,0,1

They're just normal middle-class guys who had a shot at the brass ring, and missed it. And now it's 30 years later. I felt almost the same way about *King of Kong,* for a lot of the same reasons. Hearts of Darkness is a documentary about the making of *Apocalypse Now* that is almost as compelling as the film it is documenting. They fought a war to make that movie, and they almost lost. Equally compelling, is *The Making of Tron.* A documentary that is quite a bit better than the movie it is documenting. A dozen animators, and artists from Boston managed to trick Disney into making a movie using a technology no one had ever used before, and would never use again. They were dreamers and drawers, not writers, and it shows. The film they made had a crap plot, crap writing, crap characters, but it looked like nothing anyone had ever seen before. *Lost in La Mancha* is a documentary about a film of that never got made. An astonishing story about how sometimes your work can and up nothing more than the sum over all the compromises you made trying to get it done. Until eventually, it all falls apart and there's no movie. *Jodorowsky's Dune* is a story about another movie that never got made, but one in which the director never compromised, produced something astonishing which no one ever saw because no movie ever got made. It nonetheless became one of the most influential science-fiction movies of all time.",0,0,1

c1jnjl3,"&gt;Are you then implying that Israeli/Jewish influence on American politics has little basis in reality? Yes, actually. I am not saying that there is no influence, but that this influence is greatly overblown. Often people speak about how candidates often cater to AIPAC (which, it should be noted, not all Jewish people support); but they cater to the NAACP and other organizations just as much if not more (definitely more in the case of the NAACP; they represent more constituents). These calls of excessive influence are almost always unnecessary to any argument anyway. You also have to remember that these calls of excessive influence are the same calls that precipitated the Holocaust; like it or not, it will evoke fear and defensive posturing from Jewish people. It is a sign that causes fear just as a noose hung from a tree can be used to cause fear in black Americans. Aside from being alarmist, they are often untrue; the US gives about the same aid per person to both Israel and the Palestinian authorities, so it is hardly like a war is being funded. The reality of US support for Israel is this: Israel is our most important strategic military ally in the middle east, and possibly in the world; Jewish voters tend to be swing voters, and wooing the six million or so votes can determine the result of an election (just as the many voters from other constituent groups can also swing the election); [for every American who sympathizes with the Palestinians, FOUR sympathize with Israel](http://pewresearch.org/pubs/39/the-us-publics-pro-israel-history) - so US politicians will also side with Israel. Keep in mind that the reason Jewish Americans support Israel is that many believe Israel to be the only thing preventing another Holocaust. The Jewish state ensures the survival of the Jewish people (thanks to a strong military and nuclear capability). It is a legitimate concern - for thousands of years, Jews have been persecuted all around the world, and antisemitism persists to this day, especially outside of the US (we are in a nice bubble of political correctness and equality in this nation). Whether this concern is outdated or not is of little concern (indeed, the Jewish people can't afford to make a mistake that would allow it to happen again), because it exists and will persist. The Holocaust does have real influence on the behavior and attitudes of the Jewish people and of Israel as well, so it is relevant to some discussions. There are also religious and historical attachments to the area of which I'm sure you're aware. You can't use the 9/11 attacks as justification to say that the US shouldn't support Israel (which it seems like you're doing). Terrorism has existed long before Israel, and crazy people who hate you will always have new justification for attacking you. You shouldn't change policy because of fear that a few psychos will attack (there were only 30 or so people involved in 9/11, so it is just a few). The American people are affected by every policy. Our new airport security measures, for example, have caused [242 additional Americans to die every month](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=677549). Everything has consequences, many of them unintentional - you do the best you can. It is important to keep in mind that there is also plenty of dissent within the Jewish people in the US and Israeli people about Israel (as in, settlements are a very controversial issue with Jews too, as is the use of force). TL;DR: US support for Israel is based on moral, political, and strategic grounds and has the [overwhelming support of the American public](http://www.gallup.com/poll/126155/support-israel-near-record-high.aspx). The pro-Israel lobby has no more influence over American policy than any other lobby of similar size and scale, but unlike most lobbies, most of the American public with an opinion actually supports this group (generally).",0,0,1

So why are you acting like people don't just think ""Huh, cool"", and making out like they do some mental acrobatics about it. Misconception about her nationality doesn't create any misguided notions about when she lived. Only people not knowing when she lived shows people don't know when she lived.

cgw24wf,"&gt;due to the legal fees and the money he lost in the suit the company had to shut down. OK now this REALLY doesn't add up. Unless your dad's boss was *uninsured* at the time, if he got sued his insurance company should have been providing the defense. When you're talking about personal injury lawsuits involving an accident, it's always against insurance companies--not individuals (unless they weren't insured). Moreover, if the boss was a business owner he should have had additional insurance. So even if he lost, it's not coming from him--it's coming from the insurance company. So this story is hard to believe because: 1) most areas in the US assign fault to the person who rear ends another vehicle most of the time, if not automatically (especially insurance companies); 2) If a cyclist slammed into the back of a stopped vehicle and then sued, the driver would have available affirmative defenses to limit, if not entirely negate any liability 3) If he was insured, his insurance company would have been the one paying the costs of the defense. So how he went belly up when the very institution of insurance--even being the scam it is--is to prevent that very thing...is beyond me. So I just don't know. There's something else not there.

dg6e38e,"my uncle is basically raising a ""'criminal""(hopefully not) without realizing it. both my uncles and aunts are very successful doctors in our country and are often busy so my cousin was raised by maids in a spoiled and neglected environment that constantly feeds his ego. growing up i remember he would get everything he wants, and if anyone does not ""pleases"" him (such as giving him a particular toy he wants, or making jokes at him), he would throw the biggest fit. it doesnt help that whenever he throws a fit his dad would yell at the person doing it, including my aunts, uncles, and even grandma (seniority is pretty serious in my family and he's always been my grandma's favorite). fast forward to a couple of years ago when his family visited the us (where my family lives). they were staying at my house and he started to yell at his little sister for some stupid reason. i politely told him that it wasnt nice to yell at his little sister when it was uncalled for. he replied ""do you really think you can argue with me?"". i calmly told him that im not arguing with him, i simply am telling him that he shouldnt yell at his sister when she didnt do anything wrong. he repeats the same sentence above, forgetting the fact that i'm older than him and actually have more seniority than him in the family (my dad is the oldest, his dad is the 2nd oldest in a family of 8 siblings so his dad has a lot of seniority power back in our country). at this point i just had it with him and told him that i'm not arguing with him, and since i'm older than him and he's living in my family's house he better behaves and respects everyone in my family, at which point he starts throw a fit (he's 15 at the time), in which his dad, fortunately, told him to apologize to me (probably because of the whole seniority thing) fast forward to a few months ago after my brother visited the homeland and got the family updates. since he grew up with a big ego (rich family with my uncle constantly reminds him of his status) and doesnt know how to interact with people peacefully, he never had friends growing up. not only that, he's starting to develop an interest in chemistry and explosives. last i've heard my uncle had to get rid of a bunch of tools he bought to explore more into the explosives. as my brother dug deeper into the situation, he found a bunch of internet searches and histories that this kid has been making that would definitely prompted quite a few FBI visits if he was living in the united states. i honestly dont know what came out of that and how he is now. it is quite scary to loosely observe someone growing up to potentially become a ""sociopath"" like this. hope its just a phase.",0,0,1

The north magnetic pole (actually a magnetic south pole) is several hundred miles from the geographic pole, and from what I understand the magnetic south pole (actually magnetically north) is even further from the geographic south pole. The magnetic poles drift about 25 miles per year.

I tried a couple of times to express what problems I'd had, but it was quite hard to find the right way to convey the information, but I'll try to summarize. The primary aspect of a crazy girl is her puerility - a ""crazy"" girl selfishly doesn't consider how her actions affect others, and acts like a child in order to maintain control of situations. This includes tantrums, lying and deceitful behaviour, double standards, encouraging self-doubt, accusations in order to reverse discussions, emotional manipulation, money control, denying touch or reciprocity (and I'm not talking about sex here, I mean literal physical human contact), and also refusing to communicate (as in, not responding to messages ever, never answering the phone or anything like that). I can guarantee that, in my case, it wasn't a case of ""still growing up"", I mean we were in our late 20s at the time. Also, I think the term ""crazy girl"" is not a particularly useful or productive term, because it treats a particular set of behaviours as ones that only girls have (guys can, from my observations, easily be as awful); and ""crazy"" implies insanity, which it's not.",0,0,1

cnb4zhq,"Narcissism is very difficult to formally diagnose, since the narcissist is either unaware or unwilling to admit that they have a problem. So I can't say for certain, but a psychologist has suggested to my family, based on what we have told him, that my mother is a narcissist. She was extraordinarily selfish (the exaggerated sense of self-importance trait). For example, if anything ever happened to me (e.g. got injured), she worried more about how it would make her look as a parent. She was deathly afraid of being blamed for things, and so she would be very strict with me because she was afraid of getting ""blamed"" for something that went wrong with me, no matter what it was. My mum also did not care much for the tedium of parenting, like taking me to friends' parties or extracurricular activities. She would hand the task off to my Dad whenever possible, and sometimes would outright not take me because she didn't feel like it. If it didn't feed her ego, she wasn't interested. She only liked me playing the piano because it made her look good to have a ""talented"" child -- she would apparently glaze over when my teacher discussed my lessons with her. She had a very fragile ego. Whenever we had a disagreement, Mum took it as a sign that we ""hated her"" or thought she was a ""bad parent"". She took it as a personal attack, not a simple difference in interest. And the arguments were horrendous. She would resort to personal attacks, biting sarcasm and emotional manipulation (threatening to ""give up"" on me -- essentially cut emotional ties with me -- was a common one). And she could never be wrong. Even when our dad could see that we were right about something, he would still tell us to apologise to Mum and do what she said, because he too knew that the argument would otherwise never end. He was under her thumb as well. Overall, Mum was an incredibly unstable person. Didn't make for a great childhood, but did make for some good, crazy stories to tell people.",0,0,1

My girlfriend is a single mother and we actually got in an argument over this because she mentioned that she considered doing it for the money and I said something along the lines of ""I would not respect you the same if that's what you chose to do"" she got defensive and said there's nothing wrong with working in the sex industry and that I was wrong for thinking less of someone for it. I have personally been in and out of strip clubs, I've been in the back rooms I've seen what they do. I am not just choosing to judge, I've seen the lifestyle first hand. I've dated strippers and sex workers even, so it's not that I think less of them it's that I am fully aware of how someone just looking to make money gets into a situation that they didn't bargain for and are now coincidentally addicted to drugs to forget about the situation they've landed themselves in. I was raised that you respect your body and that you don't have to exploit yourself to make good money you just have to apply yourself and work hard for that money. There's a certain amount of respect you earn from not taking the easy way out. I told her I'd rather work 3 jobs to support my child then to live in a city where all the men who frequent the clubs feel like they know me because they've seen the way I move my body or have my child grow up to know that mommy was a stripper to give you what she could, no. I just can't have it that way. We had to agree to disagree as her point was that she wouldn't want to have to work three jobs to never see her child she's rather do what she had to do to make the money she needed for the life she wanted. I think both sides have their points it just comes down to personal preference/upbringing/moral compass.

I think that's a really bad way to look at life. Hm, I should have said ""accepted _reasonable_ risks of doing so"", I suppose. If your roof collapses on you because it wasn't built safely, that's the builder's fault. If it collapses on you because a meteor hits it, that's not really anyone's fault. If you're driving on a private dirt road and a rock flies up and damages your engine, that's not exactly your fault, but it's a risk you've implicitly accepted by driving on a dirt road.

dj8xelk,"Preach it. I've struggled with weight all of my life. When I gained 30 lbs after High School, no matter how polite or kind I was in public, everyone -- but women in particular -- was rather dismissive of me. It didn't matter that I was a great student, and a hard worker; all people saw was extra weight on my frame, and they couldn't be bothered. It sucked. I decided to lose weight. I dropped it using Slim Fast and ridiculous amounts of exercise (six days per week, ninety minutes per session,) so I not only looked slimmer, but much fitter as well. The change in how I was perceived was palpable. Suddenly, I couldn't sneeze without a woman I barely knew running up to me with tissues, asking how I felt, all while touching my arm. This was flattering, sure, but when I would casually mention how I was very happily married it never, ever deterred them. Frankly, it squicked me out. In the years since, I've been on a weight level see-saw due to other non-related health issues. This has given me a chance to observe the ""Pariah / Desirable"" dichotomy several times, and it's led me to one inescapable conclusion: A person's weight and fitness level is by far and away the most important first impression they have to offer. It's not fair, and I frankly think it sucks, but it's the truth. I'm currently on a downswing again (hopefully for the last time; my health issues are squared away, and my doctor is working with me to track down the core metabolic issue) so I'm seeing the ""Desirable"" phase in action again. Even though I'm fifty, the same pretty women at the office with whom I've worked for the past few years have suddenly started dropping by my desk just to ""see how I'm doing.""

You can think of it as an individual thing, but it's still the sea. Think of yourself the same way, you are not ""within the universe"" per se as if it's separate.

You, me, your screen, your crazy aunt, the sun, the moon, the stars. We are all the universe. When buddhists say ""you will be reincarnated"", they aren't talking to 'you the ego'. They are talking to the real you, the universe. You will break down and become another form. Your 'ego', the memories and thoughts and feeling you have will die, but you, the universe will live on in a different form. Edit: To add to this, karma will not affect 'you'.

cevbvch,"Interesting. I am happy to hear you are not a 15 year old kid! hahah. First off, I know you don't want to smoke anything, but I would advise you give smoking weed a try 2 or 3 times. Just so that you can understand how you start to feel different when you are high, and can understand how even a ""light"" drug can alter your perception. I say 2-3 times because most people don't get high the first time they use marijuana. You have to hold it in a bit, but don't make yourself hack up a lung. You may get paranoid, but as long as you are in your own place with the curtains drawn no one will bother you (unless you live in an apartment, then put a towel under the door). Second one I would recommend is mushrooms. They will introduce you to hallucinating and are physically a safe drug to do. Wont make you too sick or have any lasting negative physical effects. However you REALLY should do this one with someone you trust for the first time, and someone who has done them before. They can be a real trip, and can be quite frightening if you do not know what is ""normal"" and what is not (though really, 99% chance you will experience a completely normal trip). Finally, you should try taking a pill of X. One pill isn't going to kill you. People die on X from multiple doses, building up way to much body heat, becoming dehydrated, and passing out in a club. Try doing one pill with a buddy at home on a Friday night one night. You don;t need to chug water either. Drinking a liter to a liter and a half over the 4-5 hours will be plenty.",0,0,1
cz4d9x3,"I have spent a lot of spare time the last couple of years researching WW2 with the notion of creating a campaign for a role playing game. For a long time I hunted for accounts of soldiers who had fought through the entire war in a rifle platoon. After extensive looking, I have come to a sad conclusion: such accounts don't exist. There are numerous accounts of individuals who fought in this or that battle, a few longer accounts of guys who fought through an entire campaign, but guys who fought through the whole war? Nada. The simple fact is no one in a rifle platoon actually fought through the entire war. Not in the U.S. army, anyway. The casualty rates in the rifle platoons were ferocious, but it goes beyond that. What the medical corps concluded was that the stress of fighting at the front was so great that every man in a rifle platoon eventually became a casualty. If he wasn't killed or badly wounded he would eventually become a psychological casualty: his mind broken, useless, or often an outright danger to his comrades. They even put a time frame on it, somewhere between 180 and 240 days at the front the man would go completely bonkers. This happened to EVERYONE. There were no iron men.

dfdr4nj,"How does this not have more upvotes? This actually explains what is going on. Moreover, the recent 9th circuit case (https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2016/08/29/15-16585.pdf) says that a company that is PRIMARILY a common carrier is exempt in ALL of its activities from FTC enforcement. In other words, broadband internet access providers can offer the exact same services as over-the-top services, and so long as they are primarily a carrier, those over-the-top services fall into a regulatory hole. More importantly, if this bill is passed, it will keep the FCC from passing any types of rules or regulations that are substantially similar (this is what a Congressional Review Act [CRA] resolution of disapproval does). In other words, anything that comes close to articulating the enforcement of 222 by the FCC would either be illegal, or at the very least, politically difficult. This means two things: 1) The market asymmetries complained about by the ISPs would still exist, just flipped. OTT would be regulated by the FTC, and the broadband internet access providers would fall into a regulatory loophole. The ISPs have said over and over in their public statements that they want to be regulated like the FTC, but unless the Open Internet Order is repealed, they fall under FCC jurisdiction. The FCC has the ability to simply align their enforcement of 222 with FTC practice, but would not be able to do so if the CRA passes. 2) FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is on record stating that 222 still applies to broadband internet access providers. The entire back and forth, with thousands of comments, a ton of legal text, and one hell of a lot of lobbying, was about how 222 will apply. This was in part to guide enforcement (companies: boo!!), but also to provide clarity on how enforcement would happen (companies: yay!!). If the CRA resolution passes, it will not be impossible, but will be politically very, very difficult, for the FCC to provide clarity or guidance. So while the broadband internet service providers have likely fallen into a loophole so long as Pai, et al remain in charge, if anyone takes over with a bit more regulatory zeal they will do so without any means of signaling why or how it will happen. This is not good for companies. The irony of it all is that the FCC did essentially an 175 degree turn from their initial position of what data should be opt-in vs. opt-out vs. implied consent. They moved, as per the broadband companies' desires, to a sensitive vs. non-sensitive data approach, almost identical to the FTC. The important part is the ""almost"", as they included a few more items (browsing and app histories) in the sensitive data category, something that the FTC is (or rather, was under the previous commissioners) toying with as well. It changed the game from something the broadband internet service providers felt they couldn't live with (the initial draft rules) to something they didn't 100% like but could live with. The Senate has now passed a bill that not only does away with that compromise, but removes the ability of the FCC to act in this space. This will greatly benefit the ISPs in the short term, but could really bite them in the ass in the long-run. Per the initial comments point (and as pointed out in other comments), this isn't a bill but a regulation- it was not the Obama Administration, but Wheeler's FCC. This is important, because if this bill passes, it essentially makes ""a more well-thought out"" solution impossible.",0,0,1

Trump's would have all American made beef from corporate farms, really really cheap but very unhealthy. When you ask what's in it you'll get a rambling speech on how politically correct this place is and how much the media hates him. Bush's burger would just be a patty in between two buns that are overcooked. No condiments. When you ask for them you get reminded how great 2002 was. Romney's burger would be sandwiched in between two hundred dollar bills. When you ask for bread he'll remind you that Obama tried to crash a book signing event. Cruz's burger would have live ammunition inside of it and pretty much raw beef. It would also be made in Cuba or Canada, but proclaiming to be full American made and against all foreign burgers. It would also come with a chance of it not being beef but in fact chicken from an undisclosed loan a few years ago that he made with a poultry farm. Christie's would just be a doughnut acting like a burger with ""Hillary"" written on the top.

diiywud,"I have two moments. To understand both of them you have to know I am half French, and half dutch. The first one was the world cup final of 2006. We watched it at a friend of our family, we always watched international football matches there. I was about 7 years old, and Zinedine Zidane was my absolute hero. It was his last match as a football player, and in my dreams he scored the winning goal a hundred times. He gave a headbutt to an Italian player, who allegedly instuled zidanes mother. I don't remember the italian players name, but a headbutt is always a red card in football, which means you get send off. It made me so sad, France lost the final aswel, which made the whole thing worse. Not a really good memory. The second memory is of the match Netherlands-Spain on the 2014 world cup. The expectations for me personally were really low. The previous European cup was no success by any means, and this was the first match of the next World cup, the first match back on the big stage. So I figured there wouldn't be much success. But Louis van Gaal came, saw, and conquered. I tubed about one minute in, which I usually never do for such important matches, but as I said, I didn't expect much. In the eleventh minute, Spain got a penalty, which I don't agree with, but they got it anyway, and our goalie, Jasper Cillesen, has never stopped a penalty in his live, and he didn't stop that one either. We were down 1-0. The mood became really negative afterwards, I watched it with a friend, and we both were complaining a lot. Sneijder missed a really big opportunity, which didn't made it all worse. But then, Robin van Persie scored a wonder diving header, a true beauty, just before halftime. Perfect timing, because u go resting with way better morale, and the enemy with way less, because they just conceded a goal like they have never seen before. After the break orange took over. De Vrij walked a ball in the net, Casillas slipped up, Robben outran Ramos, we all had a great time. It was the best match I had ever seen.

ded89c1,"Remember they were celebrating the women of 1918 by wearing white, that is why I used that reference. So when someone is doing something in celebration of people of 1918 you must think what was said and done in that time period. I did not say Trump raped anyone and neither have they, I was using it as a comparison. I said that because of the comments recorded on the Hollywood tape and other things that have come out that group felt that Trump has shown no respect for women. Yet he says he loves women and that, along with Bill Clinton actions, is a dichotomy of actions. You would be surprised at how many woman focused serial killers/rapist say they are. Not all do but some do. The question was about the women just sitting (not standing up cheering) there even though he just said something that women should fell positive about. I answered in the context of viewing it from their perspective. I do not portend to speak for anyone but that group had made their purpose, for dressing in all white, very clear in advance. I will never dispute anyone's right to protest peacefully. They were respectful and did not disrupt the proceedings. So the question was who was hurt by these actions and he answer was no one.

diuf0di,"You are right, it would be wrong to suggest that this person did not know a lot about love. Like I wrote further down I seem to not be able to accept that someone who truly believes they are a burden to their loved ones and choose to commit suicide is not at fault. One thing we all agree upon is that if the person would be killed by someone else, there would be a culprit, someone who wronged the one who was killed but also those that were left behind. Now just because the person kills himself does not mean there was not a killer, someone who took the life of a father of children, of a mother or of an SO or or... There was a killer and this person was at fault for doing this. And I personally truly believe that this is crucial for the people that are left behind. They have been hurt by the one they lost, but to truly say farewell they have to deal with this aspect as well. They have to forgive him/her for killing their loved one. I want to add that I do understand your post and that in the mind of those who commit suicide this can seem as the best option they have, as a relief for their environment. And I'm not a psychologist, but I believe that people can choose, at some point, the path they are following. And if I choose to believe the wrong things about myself (I'm a burden or No one loves me or I will always be alone or I am not worthy of... or whatever) it was still a choice I made and my own mistake. This sounds pretty condemning, I know, but I like to look at it as relieving. The power is in your hands and the hope is there, the future is still bright. If one can manage to look at the bright side of this and still be able not to condem themselves, this is a pretty great thing. BUT I have to say that my experience with suicide is quite different from yours. It was not someone close to me that took his own life but someone close to the love of my life and seeing how that devastated her is the experience I have with suicide. So I might just miss something due to missing empathy maybe which distorts my view on suicide. So if I was hurting you in any way I want to deeply apologize, because this happened then out of ignorance (not the ""I choose to be ignorant"" kind of ignorance, the one where I just don't know) and not out of arrogance.",0,0,1

c0k9vgu,"I have a few thoughts below, but basically it amounts to cost vs. benefit. * The freight system is more complicated than, say, automated trams at an airport. While the basic principle is still the same, the hurdles are much bigger. Way more switching, trains are harder to drive, lots of manual switching and linking, predictive nature of driving enormously big and heavy things. I'm not saying these can't be overcome; it's just that the costs to do so are crazy high. * There are huge --HUGE-- sections of our nation's railway that have no signals or systems (""dark territory"") that make automation especially tricky right now. Many chunks of dark territory have switches that are completely manual; you must have an engineer get off of the train and turn a massive crank to switch track. Also, there's no way right now for trains in dark territory to know where other trains are. It's all done with radio communication. The list goes on from there. Essentially you need major track updates for huge sections of the nation's railway in addition to ways to feed information into the train system. That's a big old chunk of change. * In many cases you'd have to turn large numbers of freight locomotives from mainly mechanical operations to fly-by-wire systems. Locos are very expensive. * Imagine the union battles. * Transitioning from a group of mostly humans driving trains to all automated drivers is very tricky. When you have 100% humans, the decision making is pretty clear, and when you have all automated systems, decision making is also clear. But what happens when you have humans AND automated trains on the same lines? Confusion, probably. It takes a lot of resources to figure out how to make that work. * I wonder what the perceived cost would be if an ""automatic"" train killed a pedestrian. Considering suicides and train yards alone, it's unavoidable. I would imagine the storm of crap generated by the media would be enormous. So basically, you could figure this out and still have a pretty big additional cost of upkeep for everything, or you could just keep humans in the loop.",0,0,1

dk55ysy,"Thanks! That's a piece by Amber Rehman, a writer for Huffington Post Canada. In it she tells her personal story of deciding to wear her hijab, and why she says it is empowering *for her* in her own personal life: &gt;My journey as a feminist eventually took me to explore my faith. Negative media helped me look for answers for the Muslim woman dilemma. Was a simple piece of cloth a symbol of oppression? I found that women were mistreated all over the world, scarf or no scarf. I did a lot of research and found that the veil in Islam was encouraged to elevate women to a symbol of respect. I was fascinated by that, because I found as a teen, self-respect was something a lot of girls struggled with. Being raised around a lot of boys and having mostly male friends I recognized that I didn't want to be objectified as sexual object. &gt;So at 16, I began my journey to covering my body. I was afraid of what people would think. But I realized, the world would judged me no matter what I did, so I better do what I feel is right. And I felt very strongly about what I believed in. I believed, a man should respect me for my mind. I believed that inner beauty should be showcased because outer beauty would fade. I cannot find an example of her claiming that forcing women in Arab countries (should that be Muslim countries?) to wear hijabs is empowering to women.

deb8ua0,"It was August 31st, 2012, and the end of a truly terrible week. Definitely one of the lowest points in my life. In fact, the only thing in my life that I had to look forward to was my visit to my brother in another part of the country. So there I was, waiting for my 6 pm flight from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City on a Friday night. There was quite the storm over Salt Lake that evening, so the plane was late arriving to IFRA. Consequently, takeoff was considerably delayed and since we had to fly around the same storm, landing in SLC was even further delayed. By the time I made it off of the plane, my connecting flight was long gone. I had no choice but to stay overnight in the city and catch the earliest flight the next morning. The hotel I stayed in was about as new as it could be. It had a very modern design and landscaping had yet to be finished. I wasted no time getting to my room. I put all of my belongings on a chair, climbed into bed, and for a few minutes watched Real Time with Bill Maher and America's Next Top Model. I opted to simply go to sleep. I wasn't tired (it was incredibly early for me), but I did have a flight to catch in the morning and nothing deserving of my attention. The next morning I quickly got ready and left my room. I ate a small breakfast quietly in the lobby. After double-checking that the shuttle was on its way, I sat down on the edge of a lounge chair with my elbows on my knees and my gaze fixed upon the floor. A pair of feet approached and came to rest just in front of me. I looked up to see a man who appeared to be in his 30's, facing me. With a clear foreign accent, he says, ""Hello. Excuse me. You look depressed. Is there anything I can do to help?"" He was an Asian man. If I had to, I would guess that he was Japanese, but I will never be able to know for sure. Donning my best faked smile, I replied that I was fine, even though I knew well it was a lie. He responded, ""Just tired?"" I obliged, repeating, ""Just tired,"" still forcing a convincing smile, and still very much lying. I had just gotten my first full-night's rest in at least a week. With that, our brief conversation ended and the shuttle arrived shortly thereafter. I spent that short ride thinking about the exchange--how strange it was to me, but also how much I admired his kindness toward an absolute stranger. I made it to my gate with no trouble, securing at least 50 minutes before the plane would begin boarding. I found myself a seat in the surprisingly empty concourse. I don't know why I was surprised; it was still early morning. I looked around and noticed that there were only a handfull of people sparsely occupying the rows of airport chairs. I also noticed a young woman sitting several rows away and facing me. Given the plethora of empty seats, I had an unobstructed, clear line of sight. I thought she was beautiful. I also thought she might have looked at me once or twice. I've always been an introvert, so approaching a pretty girl is not in my repertoire. Initiating conversation with a stranger basically constitutes mild torture. But I didn't dismiss it like I had always had. I pondered. It wasn't hard for me to conclude that I had nothing to lose, given the nature of the preceding week. It doesn't really get worse than rock-bottom. My alternative appeared to be 50 minutes of texting my dad since a nap was definitely out of the question. Even so, that wasn't enough to mobilize a chronic introvert. I still needed one thing: courage. Then I thought of the man at the hotel--the one who would go out of his way to approach a total stranger for no reason other than to show kindness. Surely I could muster enough to talk to a girl. And so my mind was made up. I grabbed my two bags, walked around the maze of airport chairs, and sat down next to the pretty girl. I had no idea what to say. I told her that striking up a conversation with a stranger wasn't my thing, but it seemed like as good a time as any to try. Over the next 40 minutes we learned a lot about each other: where we lived, where we went to school, where we grew up, what our families were like. Never the other's name, though. When it came time for her to board her plane, we said our farewells and she left. I didn't watch her walk away. I did glance over in time to see her as she reached her gate, but when I looked a moment later she was gone. For the next couple of minutes I just marinated on the conversation. I was fully aware that I never got her name. I knew that if I ever wanted to find her, the only usable information was her university and that she was from Arizona and that her father was once in the Navy. A long shot at best. I conceded to that being too unrealistic and instead valued the encounter for what it was: a nice conversation with a complete stranger. I didn't regret it. And so I waited for my plane to begin boarding. When a person is sitting alone, he or she will occasionally get the spontaneous urge look around, especially behind. Or maybe that's just me. Either way, I got that very urge as I was waiting to board. And when I looked directly behind me, I found something peculiar. At the gate where the young woman boarded her plane was a line. A sizable line. And she was in that line. She wasn't gone. It wasn't over yet. I did the smoothest thing I could possibly concoct in the moment. I grabbed my old boarding pass from the night before, walked directly to the young lady, gave it to her, said she could look me up if she ever wanted to talk to me again, and then boarded my plane. That is how I met my wife. TL;DR: I talked to a girl in the Salt Lake International Airport and later married her. Edit: Paragraph spacing",0,0,1

A number of individuals on the Albanian side, too, would want an ethnically clean Albanian Kosovo, of course, and surely would've further fueled the conflict; but Serbia or Yugoslavia could do little there, but *lodge official protests with the international community*. With all due your respect (and I have no intention to bring your personal observations into question), those are your personal observations and not a statistical analysis. AFAIK, foreign intelligence reports (and I don't mean Russian, but German) have commended the Serbian authorities for attempting to reintegrate the Albanian minority into the society. The *Milosevic-Rugova agreement* had restored the Albanian language into the education system and had began developing the self-government of the autonomous province, scheduling even (the first) free elections to be held. Let me quote German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer: *With an agreement made with the Serbian leadership at the end of 1998 [..] both the security situation and the conditions of life of the Albanian-derived population have noticeably improved [..] Specifically in the larger cities public life has since returned to relative normality.* I am not offended; but I am calling upon clear sources in here. The KLA didn't like the fact that the situation in Kosovo was normalizing, hence it *violated the peace treaty* signed with the Yugo-Serb forces, in an attempt to destabilize Kosovo, Serbia and all of Yugoslavia. And this is not something I claim, but is universally-accepted. According to the NATO, the very organization that had conducted the bombing campaign, the KLA was *the main initiator of the violence* and that it had *launched what appears to be a deliberate campaign of provocation*. The statement I had written is not totally untrue, because data speaks otherwise. The US Committee for Refugees has noted that the KLA had conducted ethnic cleansing of Serbs from Kosovo. Serbs were expelled from *all* mixed settlements with a mixed population under KLA control - the international organizations have documented that over 55,000 non-Albanian residents had fled from Kosovo, and in specific, 90 villages which were mixed had become ethnically solely Albanian-inhabited. This had *not* occurred in settlements under official state control and Albanians did *not* flee the mixed settlements that were not under KLA control. This is a fact. The *Serbian individuals and the Serb side has been indicted only and specifically for the atrocities committed in 1999*. The very first documented one being, the Racak incident in the beginning of '99. However, *the KLA-perpetrated crimes predate this, occurring in 1998 and prior*. In 2005, the ICTY has found **Haradin Bala** guilty for his actions throughout 1998 and sentenced him to 13 years of prison. Let me also remind you that a prominent Kosovo Albanian leader (former PM) and KLA commander, **Ramush Haradinaj**, is currently on trial at the Hague Tribunal for alleged crimes committed in 1998. I have no intention of predicting the outcome of his trial, but should he get convicted, that will only further confirm what I am explaining here. And yes, I am limiting myself to the war-time period - the period which is under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, from late 1991 to mid-1999. As for the usage *terrorist* - it was described that way, both domestically and by the international community, including by KLA's subsequent Western allies. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has passed a Resolution of Dick Marty, approving his report, becoming the first official international document which specifically mentions KLA's actions as *terrorist activity* (the UN documents had previously ""condemned all terrorist activity by the KLA and other factors in Kosovo"", which is considerably softened up by mentioning *and other*, not naming the KLA exclusively).",0,0,1
dikbh2g,"A hot Monday night with no a/c. The three of us (male, about 20) decide to go lie on the golf course greens a few blocks away at the top of the hill. On the way we pass a dude in tennis shorts and shoes, tshirt in hand. He says nothing as we pass. A bit weird but it's a hot night and there are three of us. We get to the green we liked, lie down and chat for a bit. Something makes me get up and I see the same dude right at the top of the hill, maybe 250' away. He's now entirely naked except for tennis shoes. I mention this to my buddies and without a word they get up and start to walk away. We're all a bit nervous when one of us says something like ""ha ha, wouldn't it be funny if two of us ran off and left one of us here alone with that guy!"" This is the cue for the other guy in our trip to run for It, but he's left the two of us. No dice. We laugh to each other and check on the guy on the hill. Who is now, completely silently, running nakedly at top speed towards us. With something in his hand. No, not that, it looked like a knife but we didn't hang around to make sure. He chases us all the way home, at one point running through waist tall grass without flinching. Fortunately we knew the area and were able to lose him without him finding our house. We get home and watch the dude walking back and forth for what felt like an hour but was probably 10 mins, weapon in hand, entirely naked, looking for us.

degf75j,"The day I found out I come from a long line of crooks and thieves.... So, this story starts back in the days when lumber was THE industry. My family lived in a small town so everybody did pretty much nothing else other than working for a farm or a lumber yard, but this was also a time in which literally the entire country was still working the land. Now, I don't claim to be any kind of expert on this business or its operations, all I know is that my great great great....grandfather (on my moms side) was working for this guy who owned this lumber yard at this time. My great great grandfather is then asked to pick up an order from another lumber yard up in New York (why that makes sense, I don't know). So, his boss gives him the money for the order then tells him to go up to NY and pick it up. My great says ""Ok, no problem."" Cut to a couple weeks later. My great returns to his boss empty-handed; no lumber, no money, nothing. He tells his boss ""I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you, I got robbed. Money's all gone and I have nothing to show for it."" Boss isn't happy but he understands that it happens. Well, then he stops showing up at work, kinda falls off the grid for about a week or so. Next thing you know, my great great great grandad is buying his own plot of land and opening up his very own lumber yard. And, to this day, my family has old money that has survived for generations off of the profits from that lumber business. We're not necessarily filthy rich now but my family as a whole has few worries about basic needs and that kind of comfort doesn't come from the teacher's salary that my mom makes.",0,0,1

I will try to never let them feel like they are a burden to us, and like I said, it will actually be so much easier emotionally having them with us. Edit: and they are so much fun.

I think the ""what if the sexes were reversed?"" arguement does not apply. I believe in equality, but I recognize there are differences between the sexes. Men are stronger and have a higher potential to hurt a woman. Plus I practice a limited amount of chivalry and slapping a woman in almost every case is way over the line.

cfxwvnj,"Worked in a liquor store for 3 years now. There are actually different types of people, and different types of alcoholics, and it doesn't always have to do with how often you see them. There are the guys who are the last customers of the night and the first customers the next day. These guys are the poorer street people who work in crappy jobs, and still smell like the vodka they bought last night. Then you have the more affluent people who will buy 2 cases a week. You also have the affluent people who will buy 3 cases of wine, but you won't see them again for a month. Then you have the collectors, especially beer collectors. These guys you will see at anytime of the day, and if a new product just got released, it doesn't matter if they bought $300 of stuff the day before, they'll be the first people in the door. But they don't tend to drink their stuff, they just collect. Then you have the people you see everyday, but come in for a bottle of wine, but always something different, and frequently you'll be asked for something new, and they're interested in the back story of whatever it is they're buying. You can sit there and talk to them for 15 minutes about this region, this style, etc. I personally love most of my regulars, just like when I was a bartender. Know them all by name, where they work, their families, etc. I like that aspect. The biggest thing for me was realizing that the reason somebody will buy a half pint of vodka everyday, and not just buy the handle that will last them 2 weeks and is cheaper, is because they will drink everything they buy, and its how they regulate what they consume.

djln3s9,"I've been studying for the past 5 years in order not to end up in a situation like that. I've seen my parents scrape money together for my whole childhood. We weren't dirt poor, but still significantly poorer than all the other kids I grew up with. Going to the supermarket and always looking for the cheapest, brandless version, family pack/best bang for your buck version of what we needed to buy. Whenever we had to buy clothes/shoes, always going for the cheapest ones they had. We were 5-10 years behind on any console/entertainment system (our first console was a Mega Drive, around 2001-2002 if I remember correctly). Anyway, as a student, I was living off the grant I got (can't study AND work in the school I was in, you simply didn't have time, except for a day job on Saturdays only or something), and my father's pension (divorced parents), so it was kinda hard. I never experienced what you're describing, and I've made sure to work my ass off in a really selective school to never have to experience it, if I can avoid it. And here's the flipside people never mention : I've been studying for 5 years, almost no holidays for 3 years, as any school holidays are spent doing internships. Countless late nights/all nighters to finish projects, study for exam, constant pressure, while some friends had dropped out of school and were playing video games all day, or studying easy stuff in uni, with maximum 12hrs of class a week (I had around 37 hours a week of just classes, not including homework, projects, studying for exams). I've spent this time working hard for the good wage I'll probably get when I'm done.

c0owjm1,"Doubled in ComLit and English and I have some advice: **Teaching**- yes, everyone says this. It is really a limitless field. I taught English abroad for a year straight out of uni and it was a fantastic experience that my subsequent employers have stated is a high selling point on my resume. Look into TEFL programmes or even cold call different school, they are worldwide and each country has varying requirements. Google is your greatest ally in this. Or, sign up to be a substitute teacher. I did this for a year as well at a rate of $115/day, $150 is it was long term and was offered a full-time position at the end of the year. **Peace Corps**- yes yes, hippies abound but I know several English major friends who are nearing the end of their time with the Corps and already have job offers. **Legal**- I found work post teaching abroad as a Legal Assistant in a small firm. The pay was good, the work was steady. While not necessarily a field I was looking to pursue a career in, it was great office experience and looks fabulous on a resume. That, and you'll learn a lot of the legal process and office politics. **Administration**- I currently work as an Administrative Assistant for an investment firm which has leeway-ed into what I like to do: Event Planning. The office is international, 100+ people and I get to plan fun stuff for everyone to do. **Camp Counselor**- Great summer job (golly I miss it) and some camps are year round. Check with large organizations like the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. A kickass summer gig as a counselor can turn into a year round salaried position at the Director level if you play your cards right and don't touch any small children. **Secretarial**- not just for girls anymore. **Marketing/PR**- so many entry level positions in this field, just be wary of pyramid schemes. If it's commission based back away slowly. **Temp Agency**- Probably one of the best ways to find a job these days. You have a skill set needed by companies in a market where they could easily choose the wrong candidate out of thousands. Get in with a few temp agencies (they have them for all fields) and they can place you. Pay may be just above livable at first but a good temp can get hired on quickly. It's easier to add you to payroll if you are competent than it is to continually pay the temp agency a fee on top of your wages.",0,0,1

People around you don't understand how you can be analytical or well educated but be unable to function in class, unable to study, unable to enjoy reading or do other 'normal' things. They assume you are lazy, faking it, or worse. Those perceptions of others become a part of you and you start wondering that yourself.

We like to entertain ourselves in that free time by playing games, whatever we could come up with. So one day when we were playing, I casually looked down the window and I saw a man; and he kind of looked at me in this weird stare. I was only a kid, and so I kind of brushed him off and went back playing with my brother. A few hours later, I decided to peek out the window again just to look outside and the same man was still there looking at my window, but this time he had something in his hand tucked behind his back and he had this subtle smile which immediately sent a signal down my spine. I flinched away, trying to figure out what just happened, so I run into the other side of the house so I could secretly take a peek out the window again. I got to the other window but this time I did it stealthily hoping the man wouldn't see me. Thankfully he didn't, but then he started to climb through the gate and when he got to the door he tried to unlock it. I could clearly see that he had some kind of cleaver tucked behind his back and I start to freak out. I run to my brother and I tell him to go to his room and be very quiet because we're playing a game of who can stay silent the longest. Thankfully he fell for the game so once he got to his room I lock it quietly and at this point I could hear a loud rattle at the door. I begin to cry silently because I had a bad feeling and when I get scared like this I tend to faint/fall asleep because the fear is overwhelming. I run to the closet and I bury myself underneath a lot of things hoping I wouldn't get caught then I fell asleep. After some time had passed, I woke up-- thinking I must be in heaven or something, but the stench of dirty clothes reminded me that I'm still in the closet. My heart begins to pound out of my chest because I heard a loud banging on the door and I couldn't stop shaking. The banging on the door got louder and louder, and I begin to cry. I keep hearing the banging, so reflexively and foolishly I jumped out of the closet and screamed ""WHO IS IT?"". My landlord and a couple of cops. They called my name out and escorted me outside to identify something. Once I got outside, I saw the same man from earlier but he was laying on the ground cuffed.

dc0l13v,"Serum sickness. I have Crohn's disease and about 8 years ago, I had a severe reaction to a Remicaid infusion. On Tuesday, I went to the infusion center and spent 4 hours hooked up to an IV as the medication was administered. On Friday, I started experiencing moderate joint pain and stiffness. I attributed it to the fact that I have a laundry list of medical issues and it being just a bad day for me. By Saturday afternoon, I couldn't move. My joints locked up and every movement was agonizing. When I finally decided it was time to go to the ER, I couldn't even walk to the car out in my driveway. I shuffled through the house, vomited on myself about halfway through from the pain, and was then carried to the car by my dad. My (then) fiancÃ© drove me to the the hospital, where he had to carry me to a wheelchair. I shit myself in the waiting room because I couldn't get myself out of the chair and into the bathroom. It was probably one of the most humiliating moments of my life. Once I got back into a room, a nurse cleaned me up and then proceeded to ask all the diagnostic questions and have me rate my pain. On a scale from 1-10, I rated it as a 12. That was the only question I could answer. I couldn't think straight, I could barely talk. It took two doses of morphine followed by two shots of dilaudid to get the pain to a manageable level. Only then was I able to explain the progression of my symptoms and any possible causes. After having imaging done on all of my major joints, they found no injuries and finally settled on the Serum Sickness diagnosis. After another shot of dilaudid, I was sent home with a prescription for loads of pain medication and instructed to wait it out the best I could.",0,0,1

Let's give me a round prescription of 20 Diopters. This means that my necessary prescription can vary from 18 to 22 Diopters just varying on the time of day. In other words, for a fairly significant period of time most days, even when wearing my contact lenses and therefore ostensibly ""corrected"" I see as badly as someone with a -2D prescription who's forgotten their glasses. On a bad day therefore I cannot clearly make out the leaves on a tree on the other side of the street (well, yeah, they're there and individual but don't ask me for a detailed description of their shape), and may or not be able to read the street signs accross the way depending on the sign in question (Los Angeles highway signs: just beautiful. Old town Europe; forget it). Computer work can also get very tiring on a bad day. Thankfully my boss got sick of the sight of me sitting nose-to-screen and has invested in a second monitor for me. This allows me to make use of the ""large text"" function in windows and also to use the magnifying glass if I really have to - this displays on the second screen so that I don't totally lose my place in the document. This is really a luxury, rather than a necessity, it just allows me to sit in a more relaxed position and I don't need it all the time or even every day. With glasses I see worse than with contacts because moving the damn things away from my eyes by just a fraction of an inch changes their effective strength. And they're made of glass and are heavy, which means there's a difference in them just settling on my nose over the course of the first hour I wear them. Add to that the hot and sweaty factor in summer. I'm actually only legal to drive in contacts, there's such a big difference between the two worlds. Without glasses or contacts. Well, yeah... if they couldn't correct my vision for some (extremely odd) reason, then I'd be legally blind. I can basically manage at home OK like this.

Personally, i think it helps to think about the whole thing like squares and rectangles. 3rd grade geometry taught me that all squares technically meet the definition for a rectangle. However, not all rectangles can be defined as squares. It seems arbitrary to differentiate between the two, at least until you specifically need a square. Much in the same way, pansexuals technically meet the description for bisexual, because they like both men and women, but its not wholly accurate to call them bisexuals, because being pan means you are also open towards transgender individuals and those identities. Moreover, one can be bisexual, and like both men and women, but at the same time they can also dislike transgender people, or be uncomfortable with dating them. It's not accurate or fair, to assume that bisexuals must be attracted to transgender individuals, simply because they like both men and women. On paper, you can go around calling every square a rectangle, I suppose, but you'd be doing so for the sake of being contrarian. Moreover, you'd be flat out wrong if you called every rectangle a square. Which is why pansexuals merits it's own definition. I'll fully admit that the descrepencies and nuances in that definition may not be useful to me, but i can imagine it's profoundly useful for someone who is transgender. having a definition like ""pan"" makes it far easier for transgender individuals to find people who comfortable with them and how they see themselves",0,0,1

c1jr84o,"I did this 2 years ago. I was 27. I fully expected my employer to deny my leave of absence request, figuring that I would have to resign. This was in the middle of the financial crisis, and our company had just laid off hundreds of employees (I worked for a financial services company). I knew I was next in line on my team, being that I had such little tenure. I figured I would probably get laid off eventually anyways, and figured I could make the argument that I would save the compnay 4 months of my salary. So, to my surprise they did grant me the leave, and I left for Europe in February 09 with my fiancee. I had saved up $12k for now real apparent reason other than for an emergency, so we spent about 3 months travelling Europe on that money. When I came back to the states, I was notified by my employer that I was laid off in the next round of cuts - 2 days before I was set to start back at my job again! That was a kick in the nuts, man. Along with me, another 500 or so were laid off. Anyhow, I did get pretty nice severance, and was on unemployment for 3 months. I didn't touch that severance and found a job at another insurance company in town. Strangely enough, I ended up back at the same employer about a year later.

It's impossible to reach these people and change them, that's just how it has always been and always will be. Therefore I don't see any other solution that completely banning and wiping out the breed, we simply can tolerate people getting killed by dogs.

de3gbhr,"&gt;Having a gun in the home is associated with an increased risk of firearm homicide and firearm suicide, regardless of storage practice, type of gun, or number of guns in the home. Guns kept in the home are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal unintentional shooting, criminal assault or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense. Rather than conferring protection, guns in the home are associated with an increased risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance. &gt;Research published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that living in a home where there are guns increased risk of homicide by 40 to 170% and the risk of suicide by 90 to 460%. &gt;The risk of dying from an unintentional gunshot injury is 3.7 times higher for adults living in homes with guns, with handguns in the home posing a particular threat. &gt;On a state-wide level, states with higher rates of household firearm ownership have been shown to have significantly higher homicide victimization rates.

ddp4wf1,"My favorite proposal-related comment. (I know because I didn't see any other ones in my ""saved"" list while I was tracking this one down.): &gt;It will be fine! My husband proposed while we were on a trip. Well, he wanted to do it at the convention we were going to, but kept leaving the ring at the hotel in the morning. All weekend passed by with no proposal. That Sunday, we were waiting standby for a flight home. Planes kept filling up and we couldn't get home. I was freaking out because I was in my last year of uni and had already missed classes to come. If we didn't get a flight that day, I would miss another day's worth of classes. &gt;So then my husband, who was sitting next to me, swivels down onto the ground in front of me on one knee while grabbing the ring from a side pocket in his backpack. I was so flabbergasted I honestly don't remember him saying anything to me. He claims he said something about that weekend being the best adventure he has ever had with me and that he wants to have many more together. My brain was pretty much fried from the weekend and trying to get a plane. &gt;Any proposal where you don't accidentally wish her dead or maimed will be a great proposal because it is coming from the person she loves. If you think she's worth it, and she thinks you're worth it too, it works out. Maybe the story's sweet, or maybe it's funny, or maybe it's embarrassing... whatever. The only important thing is that it's always *positive*, because it's a positive experience; the story will reflect that when it's told. ^(*Edit: Formatting/Spelling*)",0,0,1

c0netev,"It was a magical time, the summer of 2005. I was 18 and had just finished highschool a month earlier. I had been accepted into the program I desired at my university of choice and was going to be picking my classes in about a week. I had a rad job, an absolutely amazing girlfriend and then best of all, my ""affordable dream car,"" a heavily modified 1991 Nissan 240sx. Her name was ""Ol' Bessie"" and it was just awesome. Unfortunately for me at the time, I had a bit of an attitude problem. I was convinced, absolutely convinced that nothing bad could ever actually happen to me. I was in control of everything around me and sure, bad things could happen to some other guy, but never to me. I guess it's fairly common growing up; that feeling of invincibility. It was a very wet, rainy summer and the night of Monday, July 26th at about 11:30pm was no different. I had just left a friend's place and was driving home. I'd like to stress at this point that I was 100% sober (verrified by both witness accounts and blood tests...I was under no influence (other than my own stupidity and recklessness) when I made these decisions). I was doing approximately double the posted speedlimit (120kmh in a 60 zone) down a rather empty (due to weather and time of night) main road near my house...just about two minutes away. It was at this point that I hydroplaned and struck the lefthand side curb. Bouncing off of that, I spun across the street and jumped the right hand side curb, leaving the paved surface of the road and sliding across the grass that ran adjacent. At this point, I had spun about 130 or so degrees clockwise while still sliding in a forward direction and it was then that I struck a lightpost. The aforementioned orientation of my vehicle meant that the point of impact was right on the rear end of my driver's door...about 4-6 inches behind my seat. I was travelling 93km/h a the time of impact and the light post penetrated about two feet into the vehicle, completely obliterating the drivers section where I happened to be. I was wearing a seatbelt, but the impact moved my seat forward and to the right, obviously. This left me in quite an awkward position. I had shattered my pelvis and left femur, fractured my right femur and fractured every single rib on my left side. All but about 4 ribs on my right side were also fractured. I had a hairline spinal fracture in my lumbar region (I forgot which vertabrae) and a fractured left humerus. Both lungs suffered multiple punctures and my thorasic diaphragm collapsed. Additionally, my kidneys were partially crushed and my bladder was severly lacerated. I also had several internal lacerations and was internally bleeding quite severely. I tore my mitralvalve, leaving it with a murmer and I sustained several significant peripheral nerve injuries, most notably to my L5 Spinal Nerve. That being said, somehow, remarkably, I avoided any sort of head injury or spinal cord injury. EMS arrived in a few minutes and ""Jaws-of-Life'd"" me from the vehicle. In the hour or so it took for them to extract me from the vehicle (as well as load me into a helicopter for an airlift to the hospital...which was only a few minutes away) I had lost conciousness and the ability to breath on my own. 8 pints of blood (~4L) were also lost during this first hour. Upon landing at the hospital, I did regain conciousness and after the first round of emergency surgery, I was put into a drug induced coma. The internal bleeding was too severe to be stopped all at once. I bled out continually for about four days and spent most of that time on a pretty much constant transfusion. I had several chest tubes inserted to deal with the lost blood, but still had several hematomas. I was also on full life support for about 8 days...just about everything (with the exception of my kidneys, oddly) failed...in just about every sense my body was trying to die at this point. I remained in the coma for three weeks, undergoing several reconstructive surgeries to rebuild the bones I had shattered. I was initially unresponsive to external stimuli for a few days, but I slowly began to come out of the coma. I started to fight and attempt to pull at IV lines and the breathing tube, so I was then tied to the ICU bed...that's really not a fun way to wake up. I was under full spinal precautions (including an awful neck brace) and the PNS injuries meant so that I couldn't move or feel my legs...for all I knew they were no longer there. Being tied to the bed and unable to communicate verbally (breathing tube) didn't make the experience a pleasant one. Fluid began to collect in my lungs and I developed Pneumonia, something which I didn't have the strength to fight off. A tracheotomy was preformed, as the breathing tube was facilitating the development of the inflamation, some how. Soon after that, I got a blood clot in my right knee. A small filter was inserted in a vein down stream of the clot and I began a Heparin regimen. The filter was removed about 2.5 months later through a vein in my neck via a long wire with a hook on the end. I was awake and fully concious/aware for that entire surgery (local anesthetic was used on my neck, however). It was awful. I also contracted a weak MRSA infection while I was on the trauma unit. Several of my surgical sites became badly inflamed and infected, and additional surgeries had to be carried out to clean everything up. I spent three months in ICU/Trauma and afterwards, I was sent to an auxillary rehab unit where I had to learn how to walk again. I had very limited muscular control over my lower body, however no nerve pathways were severed and over time, I began to regain both sensation and muscular control. I lost over 75lbs during this time and at the worst point...weighed about 80 lbs (i'm 6'3""). I literally looked like someone you saw in the old Holocaust films that you saw in highschool. I literally had nothing left on my body. I spent an additional two months in rehab and I was discharged from the hospital (the week of Christmas, 2005...5 months after my original injury.) By all accounts, I never, ever should have survived that first night, let alone the entire experience. I've had 12 major surgeries including the implantation of 5 titanium plates along with 4-5 dozen screws. There's quite a bit of wire still in my chest that was used to hold a few ribs and my sternum together while they fused. At one point, about 2 months in...a section of this wire right in the middle of my chest came loose and over a period of two days, bored its way through my chest - 'Alien' style, until in punctured through my skin. That's really not a nice thing to see. Additionally, I now have a mechanical heart valve in place of my original mitral valve. I've had 12 CT scans, 4 MRI's, three NMPerfusion scans and probably several thousand X-rays and dozens of minor medical procedures (coronary angiogram, etc) A little over 550 stitches, sutures and staples were used through all of this and I spent two years in outpatient physiotherapy. Since this has happened, I've returned to school and am nearing the completion of a mechanical engineering degree and about to start an internship at a biomedical engineering design firm. I hope to persue a master's degree in biomedical engineering as well, in the hopes of persuing my interest and passion in medicine and combining that with my natural interest in engineering. I also volunteer with a program once a week at the hospital I nearly died at, speaking to youth (generally grades 9 - 12) about life, decisions, risks and my own experiences. Oh...I'd like to say...I was the sole occupant of the vehicle and the only vehicle involved...so thankfully no one else was injured by any of this. **TL;DR - I made a poor decision or two, took a risk and paid quite dearly for it.** edit: Added the above TL;DR :)",0,0,1

dfacs85,"Some advice needed- Sorry for long post- back story of how I got to where I am I am feeling a little lost. I have recently come back from traveling around the world after two and a half years. A large part of me traveling was the fact that I was in a job I didnâ€™t want to do anymore and my dad having terminal cancer made me realize how short life was and the glimpse of tranquility and calmness I saw on his face really made me want to feel the â€œsense of freedomâ€ he felt from packing his bags with little money he was happy being able to have the freedom travel gave him. I went traveling and loved it, I experienced new things did things I never thought I would and realized that a large part of me when I was back at home had given up on myself since university. I studied photography a subject I had huge drive and passion for. Believing that I would I could be the next big photographer. At this time of studying my then boyfriend moved in with me and it all went down hill from there. I made my life about making sure he was happy, stopped doing things for myself and to be honest just felt as if I was no good at photography. Instead of learning the things that I didnâ€™t understand I simply saw every failure as me being a failure and in the end the guy I thought was going to be with me forever left me. I do not want to blame him or anyone else for my failures and I know that we just werenâ€™t suited. After this ended up being back with my parents after failing my degree graduating with a third. (at the time I thought I should have deferred my last year to get myself in the right mental head space but instead I listened to others and carried on in my third year despite having depression. This isnâ€™t anyone elseâ€™s fault and I should have listened to my own instincts.) I then did a charity fundraising job after graduating a job at first I thought would be a stop gap and with encouragement I got promoted a number of times to being a coach. Whilst I felt this wasnâ€™t something I wanted to do forever I ended up staying in those role for four years after getting promoted. I enjoyed managing people, coaching people and making a difference in regards to medical fundraising. This is partly where I realized I like talking to people and helping them, hearing their stories and at times I would end up almost counseling them. When I was traveling I came to learn more about myself and feel a lot more confidant and felt like I could do anything. I was also foolish in spending way too much on a credit card (now owing 6 thousand pounds) I ended up loving Australia but thought it would be silly to do a job just for sponsorship if I hated it and in the end I ran out of time to find work like this. Not having a specific skill they needed also made this hard. So now I am here back with my parents, knowing I want to sort out my life but not sure where to start. I donâ€™t want to get stuck in a dead end job for the rest of my life, I want to be independent not lazy anymore but feel so much pressure from myself and others suggesting I do this and try that job out. I thought about training in Nursing or Social work but realize owing 6 grand and not having any experience in these fields I didnâ€™t want to rush into it and do another degree that I wouldnâ€™t use. The course also starts in 5 months and I realized that they might not be enough time to figure out if I wanted to do that or not. My concern about this is I am not very strong at mathâ€™s and I need to resist GCSE mathâ€™s I also thought that if I was doing it to just get back to Australia but hated those professions it wouldnâ€™t help me. Despite the fact that when I was away I thought this would really work with my empathetic nature and naturally I do like helping people with their problems or listening to their stories. I also have this interest in doing my photography and my dream would be to one day have my own business doing make up, photography and hair styling for photo-shoots and get paid to do photography (there are also issues in this in the fact that I am not sure what area of photography and I think the fact that I failed before with certain lighting it makes me go back to those feelings) But I see others who went to the same courses as me and in the end excelled and now do this for magazines something which makes me feel a little like a failure. â€“ I felt as if I trained as a hairdresser and make up artist I would have a wide range of options. I also liked the idea of being a photography lecturer but with my degree grade and the fact I am weak on the technical side. I donâ€™t think I have many options on this route. So at the moment I donâ€™t know what to do, I have applied for sales jobs, travel agent jobs, and hospitality jobs and call center jobs- (something which I really want to get out of but at the moment I owe 6 grand so and have hardly any money so I do need a paid job for now) One minute I think pursue hairdressing, make up and photography -its all practical would eventually lead to me able to be freelance in these areas and id I did hairdressing I could qualify and then go to Australia on a student visa and find sponsorship there (that would only be if I enjoyed hairdressing I donâ€™t want to do it and hate it) The next minute I think I want to just travel again once I clear my debt as I could still do a working visa in Canada before I turn 30 â€“ however it would mean I would come home to the same issue of not knowing what job to do. I also wanted to try stand up comedy but that would be more of a hobby and just to prove to myself that I am not the shy person I once became. I ultimately would like to be back in Australia but doing my photography and makeup. However I am not even sure if this is possible. I feel so stressed out that I know I need to break these things into smaller steps but I just donâ€™t know what to do first. The stress of owing this money, living with parents, scared of going no where in life I feel trapped. So far I have tried to be proactive and I have done a photo shoot since coming back, they actually look really good. looking through my travel photos made me realize I do love photography I just get scared of failing. I am also trying to assist a local photographer to improve my skills and get some hands on experience. I am soon to be 29 years old and I donâ€™t want to go down a dead end path. I found from my working life I do not want to work behind a desk, I like to be practical, I like talking to people, I love being creative. I want to move forward in my life and I be my own boss. Any suggestions or advice id really appreciate. Sorry for long post! Helps to get out of my head!",0,0,1

I took your comment as hypothetical, I wasn't agreeing that people actually do that. &gt;It's a bit of a generalization on your part, that I'm going to think and act like the stereotype you've been taught. We're all a product of our upbringing and implicit biases, but we always should be aware of them. I don't say this unkindly or condescendingly--I just know I want my biases mentioned whenever they show up. That's not a generalization, it's an educated guess. It has less to do with stereotypes and more to do with the logical fallacies that people tend to use when discussing certain types of beliefs. I've had this conversation many times and it always goes the same way, it always goes about the same way, present discussion not excluded. But anyways, if you're fine with having your biases pointed out, what exactly is the problem here?? &gt;Sorry, my bad. That was a reference to Animal Farm, where the pigs (the upper-class in power) were saying their society was one of equals. When confronted with the hypocrisy of that statement, they said that they were 'more equal' as a way of saying that they were better. I'm getting the impression that you missed the point of that analogy lol. &gt;I do, of course, want equality. It's why I'm talking about this with you. This is a biased assumption, and one that we really ought to work on, especially in progressive movements. No, it's an assessment. &gt;While historically this has been the case for most majorities throughout history...a truly equal society requires that we trust one another and teach our younger generations about the importance of equality. This is a soft way of blaming the marginalized for their own marginalization. &gt;As hard as it is to work with, the majority's will (at least, a large number of them) is required for progress. This is the gas lighting I was talking about earlier. But yes, that's why black kids were met with open arms when they integrated schools lol :) Here's another way of looking at things -- the majority's power is waning and they're decreasing in numbers. Which is why many of them resort to scare tactics. &gt;If the majority wants us to go back to the '20s in terms of gender roles and race relations, then that's where we'll go. Meanwhile in reality, our society always ends up moving forward instead of backwards. &gt; At the GOP convention, people (these are the most hardcore Republicans, who are the most serious about the reds winning) outright gave a standing ovation to an openly homosexual individual. Not surprised or impressed. These types ""love the sinner but hate the sin"". This is very surface level understanding of the issue. &gt;I think our ideal societies are quite identical. No, they aren't, not even close. I'm not about unity and all that fluff. I want to tear down the same power structures you ultimately want to uphold. &gt;Resentment is only a feeling, true...but feelings have more power than facts, sometimes. If I feel oppressed, I'm not going to act the same way as if I felt that I was valued equally. Awesome. Now imagine how people are going to act when they actually *are* oppressed. You have the ability to empathize with that to a small extent, but yet you have no problem asking us to put *our* feelings aside, when you refuse to do the same. That's what I call majority entitlement. &gt;If we want to have true equality (the ultimate long-term goal) then we have to remove that resentment from both men and women. Nope, any kind of progress the minority makes will threaten the majority. Why, because equality requires the majority give up a bit of their power. Progress always make the majority ""feel oppressed"". You literally can not have both. If we want *liberation* the rest of us have to rise up and *seize* power. &gt;Always keep the ultimate end goal in sight--if you don't, you'll get lost in the details and lose purpose and direction. I agree completely, which is why I don't let feelings or hypotheticals distract me. &gt;You hold the same beliefs, but you're better at articulating them than most. I know.",0,0,1

Really sad story. Basically they had been married for something like 60 years, both had medical issues, and both had sold the home and were going to move to separate nursing homes in the next few days.

c1e6tzz,"Do you share bank accounts or credit cards with her? You can see how this can cause many relationships to go sour. Letting your girlfriend live with you for free is similar. For some people, two years is a very serious relationship. For others, it is nothing. From my point of view, girlfriend is not a fiancÃ©e or a wife. Serious problems can develop when people share money/wealth. In your situation, you are sharing your biggest financial asset and your future earnings (a loan/mortgage is a contract to give up your future earnings) with your girlfriend for free. I believe that people are generally good, but if you set up a system where you can be taken advantage of, you can create bad behavior. In this case, your girlfriend has a strong incentive to view you as a money source (free place to live) as well as a boyfriend. That can plant the seeds for trouble in the future. Example: She is less likely to voice her concerns and more likely to put up with bad behavior from you because she is dependent on you for housing. This might sound great in the short term, but it is not healthy for a long term relationship because you would become more and more of a provider than a lover. And by posting on this board, there is clearly something on your mind saying that it isn't fair that you pay for her housing. That can only grow over time. My suggestion is to charge her cheap rent. It would be fair to charge her a rent that is cheaper than getting a single room, since she is effectively ""roommates"" with you (i.e. how much would it cost for her to roommate with someone else?). So if things do go wrong and you guys split up, she got a good deal because she got cheap housing and you got a good deal because you got some money in return.

Now, recall that six months ago, Donald Trump was elected to the highest office in that government. The government that I'm supposed to trust with my healthcare choices (oh, and to pay what they decide I should pay for the privilege) is the same government that is now run, more or less, by him and the people he appoints.

cfchy0f,"Death, natural and accidental, would be seen as the gravest of tragedies. I could see humans becoming more deliberate; society quieter. Elders would be respected: I mean, imagine having an ancestor that remembers the colonization of the Americas, and lived through seeing the steam engine up to the ion engine be invented? Families would be much more dynastic, as a result, and the family unit much stronger. You could potentially have a great-grandparent from a three-digit year (AD). Following this logic, history itself would be much less mutable, and every family would have its own oral tradition, and histories passed down directly. I don't think anything could keep humans from accelerating in change, but with longer-lived humans, I think a lot of the mistakes such as war, genocides, and what not would be repeated less often, and for that matter, war would be a serious, serious, thing. Depending on the physiological changes that would occur, I could see wars becoming more of an old-man's game, that is if humans remained physically able and robust for 300+ years. You could be a grandparent at the age of 100 and still be considered a child. Class systems would be much less fluid, less chance of moving between them, if there were even class systems to begin with. Education would be longer, with someone gaining mastery in multiple fields over the course of a lifetime not unexpected. People would move much more often (relatively), as the pressing need to spend your life with your family wouldn't be there as you have almost 400 years to disappear, come back, reconnect, disappear, and so on. I'm envisioning an almost technocratic, monastic, global society, where an almost nomadic lifestyle is encouraged, and inter-personal relationships are not rushed. Courting someone would be a glacial game of tactical nous, and love seen less as ""for life,"" and more of ""for now.""

c085dtg,"&gt; I think the world is overpopulated, and that we should eventually agree impose a worldwide system where reproduction is controlled and limited. Scientists, professors, astronauts and useful people should be allowed to reproduce all they want, while regular citizens such as myself should be allowed to reproduce only once. I think any system of social order that segregates people into reproductive ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" is not worth preserving. Better to overpopulate and collapse catastrophically once in a while than preserve an unjust order forever. False dilemma anyway. I daresay we will take care of overpopulation in a more enlightened and just fashion... totalitarian ""solutions"" to overpopulation (or anything else for that matter) are guaranteed to fail.",0,0,1

ddsv23e,"The claim based on both anecdotal evidence and simple farmer economics. There are plenty of farmers in my region, and I've worked with many of them so I've seen the conditions and animals and it's easy to tell they don't mind hanging out and eating. Not to say that there aren't people out their who treat their animals poorly, but all of the farmers that I know take great pride in their work and their animals. There's also quite a few studies that show that happier animals ""produce"" better, so happy animals make sense economically as well. And I'm not saying that animals in the wild are unhappy, but biologically speaking food and shelter are rewarded by the brain with good feels. In the case of animals with both wild and domestic counterparts, for example feral vs domestic cats, the domestic ones would be more content (in my opinion), and not have to worry about starvation and all of the other unpleasantries in the food chain. I'd definitely choose being born. Death is an inevitability, and if I could sign up before hand for the ""painless"" exit package I'd do that without hesitation. Regardless, it's not a pleasant business, but say for example we compare a wild fowl with 70% infant mortality rate with chicken culling 50% infant mortality rate. Even with the admittedly unpleasant process the chickens still fare better. Even into adulthood, wild animals don't live to a ripe old age, since predation, starvation, exposure and disease will catch them long before that.",0,0,1

dglf9o0,"At times, people like that are worth much more than family. In my personal sorrows, it was having to cut off my mom after 16 years. It really made me think of what the meaning of family really was. Even if the number shrinks it doesn't matter as long as you know that they are truly there for you. When you have times that you have to question what loving your family is or feels like, learning the answer makes all the more impact. I learned that it's more important for me to give the love than to receive it. I felt what it was like for 16 years to be denied love that should have been right in front of me. I should of been tucked in a timeless bed of motherly love. I now take what my family says to heart all the time, even when joking, because I knew what it was like to not have my voice be heard. At least when you're the one giving the love you know some good is coming out of it. Sometimes that is just what they need. Sometimes there are things that are just too much to ask of someone. Putting yourself in their position and analyzing their point of view can help you realize why decisions have been made and where to go from there. It's one of the hardest things to do. You feel as though you shouldn't have to put yourself in their shoes, they hurt you, not the other way around. This doesn't dismiss what they did, though. I recently realized something based off a two year old simmering realization. It had been just a few months after I had cut off my mother that I realized I no longer loved her. I was on a walk, as I have had many with my dad, and I had been going to therapy for a few months. That realization could be put equal to my heart physically breaking, but I needed to get through that in order to finally start healing. For two years I would tell myself that I hadn't forgiven her for her abuse and neglect because I no longer had feelings towards her at all (whether love or disdain) so I didn't even need to forgive because I was already past it. I realized this past month, though, that I already had forgiven her long ago. It was because I allowed myself to move past and get to a point that I had no feelings toward her whatsoever. I allowed myself to move on, therefore I forgave her. All this time I had a mindset that if I forgave her it would delegitimize her wrong doings. It doesn't. The price she has to pay is not having had any contact with two of her three children (who are adults) for two years. Despite me still feeling the pain, she is the one with the true punishment: almost all of her family has pushed away from her, she lost her job, will probably divorce the husband she married right away, and has a disease that will probably end her life. It is now on her to forgive herself and move on. I still have my great family and am trying my hardest to be successful. I didn't have a mother's love despite her being right there, but what I was robbed of I make up in self worth and love. So don't let what actions they make run your life. I let that happen for the first few months and was a wreck. Let go and forgive. You will feel much better. Make yourself the priority; what they make of their lives shouldn't affect yours. Try to give them love as much as they're worth. If you find yourself in the position of not being able to find love towards them (as I learned hate stems from love, so that's why I didn't really hate my mother because I didn't love her), just forgive them. Once again put yourself as priority. Forgive them not for their sake, but yours, no matter how insignificant or completely life changing.

But they wanted you to see the property anyways because they felt it was a good fit for what you need. -they may be on a showing time crunch. A cut off at a certain time. Homeowners wanting to come back home. -they may want to show you the property as a comp but have other properties for you to see that are better. Like showing you two cars, they will show you a beat up 5k car and then a nice clean lower mileage car for 10k. They don't want to dwell on the 5k car. It's not as good of buy. They want to show you within your budget what you could get that's better if you change what you are looking for. You NEED a 3 bed 3 bath updated. They show you something in your price range that isn't updated but a 3/3. Now on to the 3/2 updated for the same price. Would you rather have that 3rd bath or an updated house? Do you really need that 3rd bath? -they may have another showing at that house with other clients and don't like double booking or open house style.

What's worse is you get really inconsiderate people i.e. this mother shoved herself and her two children in front of my brother and I. This really annoyed me as there were other, taller people roundabout that she could have pushed in front of instead, and her daughter (probably about 14) was about a foot taller than me, spoke throughout the concert, kept putting her arms up and out to take photos with her phone blocking even more of my view, and wasn't even a fan, as I could clearly hear her say that she was going to go and buy the latest album when she got home, and that she hadn't heard about half the songs before. Yes, I know everyone is jostling for a place, and that everybody was trying to have a good time, but it just seemed so rude? The constant chatting, filming etc. And I know I could have (should have?) said something or moved but there were lots of little kids about and not much space to move about in, so I didn't want to start something that could potentially lead to an argument.

cne4uxc,"Nah, I wouldn't say that I was ""religious"" in the sense that it ever led to an psychological or existential crisis. Here's the best way I can explain that comment. I was raised going to church when I was a kid, but the religion is pretty intertwined with my ethnicity (Greek Orthodox). So, it was a cultural experience as much as it was a religious one, since so many of our parents or grandparents were immigrants and it allowed us to be involved in organizations to promote and preserve the culture. Thus, I got to learn Greek dancing, work at food festivals, go to Greek school, and meet a bunch of other Greek kids from my hometown on weekends when I was a kid. Intellectually, I'd describe it as such. My parents believe and encouraged me to read about the theory of evolution. (Mom even took me fossil hunting when I was a kid, and it was sweet finding a seashell up a mountain hundreds of feet above the river. And no, that wasn't God trolling me.) And my dad knows a lot about astronomy, so he would talk to me about the Big Bang, number of stars &amp; galaxies, Drake Equation, etc. from the time that I was 8. Basically, his stance was, ""Yo, Jesus Christ was an interesting historical figure, and the Church Fathers wrote some great philosophy about him.

dj7mb1u,"&gt; The transition would have to be figured out but I see no reason it would ruin the economy. The money is simply being reallocated. Instead of paying people through subsidies you just give them the money directly. You are not paying people based off of need. People who need a lot of funds will not get enough, people who need little will be overpaid. &gt; That requires new jobs in those fields. People cant just simply go to other industries if those industries are already filled and many of which also being automated. Like I said it could be that new markets form like they have in the past and it works out but Automation still has differences compared to the past that make it possible the new markets wont. Automation is slow. It doesnt kill industries overnight &gt; Based on? Like I said agian currently most UBIs couldnt cover what wed want them to but its also not unfeasible. What you do is you basically dont give UBIS to people once their incomes are high enough (basically you tax it back from them) which saves you a lot compared to literally having to given the money to everyone. Then that isnt a UBI, and people have no reason to increase their income above that threshold &gt; Thats a pretty big made up number. The entirety of Millitary spending is currently 600 billion. We currently only spend 154 Billion on vets as a whole. 190 Billion would be astronomically above even a conservative estimate of what this extra care would cost.

c0offe6,"Forever remembered as ""That Floppy Disk incident"" amongst my friends... I was in college, we spent a day doing what all college students do. Eg, we had our first lecture and then hit the bar. And, well, that was it really we never left. After a day of drinking we headed home to a friend's dorm room and continued drinking, and drinking. I was plastered by this point and began drinking straight Archer's, 1/3 of a bottle or so I was told later. Archer's has a tendancy to upset my stomach. At this point it gets a bit fuzzy, but I apparently felt I needed to go to the bathroom (hardly surprising really) and vaguely remember not feeling well. After that... it's blank until I wake up the next morning in my own bed, which happened to be in a different building (our dorm rooms where spread out across a fairly large campus). I've no idea how I got there. What apparently happened was this, I vomited EVERYWHERE in the bathroom. A shared bathroom I might add. Then apparently I staggered home. I didn't have a spot of vomit on me, so maybe I cleaned myself up. I did not provide the same courtesy to the bathroom :) The first my poor friends new about this was a very early wakeup call from a very angry cleaning lady. She basically made them clean the whole mess up. The Floppy disks? Well I used to keep a couple in my coat pocket, as I vomited they flew out and ended up in the toilet. Then the cleaning lady tried to flush 'em (don't ask me why) and they got caught in the u-bend. So... someone had to fish them out. I certainly don't do things in short measures... I woke up to several very angry e-mails and phone messages. And the killer of all hangovers. And, I had to buy everyone drinks to apologise the next time we went out of course! The cleaning lady (whose name was Shirely) laughed off the incident, she was a really cool person and had seen it all many times.

cfwypvn,"&gt; When we as people can understand that people will do horrible things no matter their resources, the right approach will never be to ""hand out"" weapons to every citizen. How do you know? It hasn't been done before, and it's at least one of the more interesting solutions to crime that I've seen. If you know with certainty that the house you are going to break into has an armed homeowner, are you really going to break in? With the 3D printing technology very quickly becoming a reality, with schematics on printing guns already available, this may become the only solution. Not something I'm particularly convicted of. &gt; I belive the more reasonable solution is a cultural change Well, living in in a Utopia without crime would be the best solution, yes. Is it reasonable, as in realistic? Not that I can see. But I can't pretend to know the future. &gt; We cant apply laws and regulations based on a very very small minority, as in this case; the maniacs with guns in the US. [In total, 6,977,700 adults were under correctional supervision (probation, parole, jail, or prison) in 2011 â€“ about 2.9% of adults in the U.S. resident population.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States). I think that's a significant number of people. While this is not necessarily the number of people who are violent and/or pose a threat, it is the number of people with some disregard for the law. I also point out, as I did in the original post, that having a gun for home protection is just one of the reasons to own a gun. The primary reason, the reason it was put in the second amendment, is to ensure the power of government always remained in the hands of the people. Also, should there *ever* be a law that says you can't protect yourself from the minority? No. &gt;This minority are not the citizens case to solve by handing out guns. I have no idea what this means. &gt; But more vaguely, if you reflect over the crime rates and horrible this and that's in The US, and compare it to other western comparable countries, youll notice most countries are far better off in regards of violence, without these gun laws. Which also proves that the ""guns for everyone"" mentality is not the most viable solution. Other countries are a proof of that. Ofcourse theres another factor that flaws this statement, which is cultural differences. Let's break this down a bit. Comparing crime rates doesn't work, as you've stated because of the cultural differences, not to mention that crimes are defined differently from country to country. However, looking at a crime rate of a country or area across before/after implementing gun control paints a fairly good picture. In [London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_London), handguns were essentially banned in 1997. Aside from the occasional spike or valley, the number of homicides has remained about the same from 1996, the lowest it had ever been recorded at 139, most recently at 148. Including population growth, I do concede that the general trend has been decreasing. However, take a look at robbery. It spiked tremendously after gun control was passed, literally doubling from 1998 to 2002. Looking at [Washington D.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Washington,_D.C.), where the handgun ban was overturned in 2007, 2010 saw the lowest violent crime rate and lowest property crime rate since 1995 (property crime rose by 0.7% from 2009 to 2010, but statistically insignificant). &gt;And yes, its good to know youll ATLEAST know your target before you shoot it. But once youve reviewed your target, and you hypothetically consider it a threat of some sort. Do you REALLY have to shoot it? Would there be more viable options? Impossible question to answer due to its nature, but in most cases, without needing any facts to back it up, I strongly believe that you would almost never need to use your gun, as other solutions will most likely be better. With any luck, I would never need to fire my gun. Ideally I could point my gun and shout at the person, and hopefully the person would either bolt or freeze. However if that person is armed, I want to always make sure I'm not on the receiving end of a weapon. &gt;But if you on the other hand mean that theres a persistent threat towards you, your family, property, which makes it natural for you to own a gun, then you actually should just reflect over that problem itself.

c7v4mp1,"There is already some really good relationship stuff, so I will put out some overall things. - Just realize there is a tendency to be little emotionally ""amped"" and sensitive in high school. For the most part, people take things a little more dramatic or harder in high school. So realize that bias and don't take things so damn hard or extreme. In fact, people are attracted to people who take things in stride. - Realize that you are developing. Develop good habits now! Your behaviors will turn into habits, and can stay with you your whole life. Now don't get too crazy or stressed about it, but realize that it is harder to change as you get older. So for example, if you procrastinate on doing homework, realize that this behavior can stay with you and even influence other areas besides homework. Which adds to the next point&gt;&gt; - Discipline. Develop it. Life is about discipline. As an example, doing homework is just practice, and a practice in discipline. It doesn't matter if it is mindnumbing, that's not the point. What matters is that you do it, and try to do well. That is what your grade represents. Can you take a test and not do your homework? Sure, but that is not the point. Can you still graduate and not do hardly anything? Sure, but that is not the point. Daily activity is the point. The things you will do best (and/or stay with you) are the things that you do a little each day, and especially take time to do. Well, that is all it takes in life. So if you want to get good at something, you will spend some time each day to do it. Well, there are a lot of things you need to show some proficiency with in high school, aka classes - math skills, reading skills, etc. So they make you do a little homework for each class each day, and you go to each class at the times they designate. You think it may be too easy, not challenging, or you are not interested so you view it as a waste of time or an almost tortuous thing to do. You are missing the point. Well, think ahead. You will be busy as an adult, but the things you take a little time out of your day to do are the things that you will be proficient at. An example, so later in life you come home with stress from job and work, and well, that fifteen minutes you would like to spend on the guitar to better yourself (substitute any hobby or self-improvement), well, you just let it slip or don't feel like doing it at the time. After all, it was a stressful day, reward yourself. You may even have a relationship and family that interests you, you give your time there since it is rewarding and a good thing. Two years later, you look at your guitar, dusty, now you just stare, you don't know how it happened but you can't even remember how to play one song. In an odd way, you realize, school turned into work, homework turned into activities after work. You hated homework, and oddly now you struggle to find any life outside of work. You realize you are not fulfilled, you focus more on your family or doing nothing, watching TV maybe, thoughtless activity. Something is off though. It comes out eventually. DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!! - Discipline is also about doing the things you don't want to do or feel like doing. How you handle it, how you cope with that, can decide so much in your life. Thought follows action many times. It means that while doing something, it changes your mood. So don't focus on ""feel like it"" when it comes to action, especially on things that are beneficial to you. - So combine the previous two points, an example with procrastination. You don't want to do homework, so you put it off. That behavior can lead to a habit. Next thing you know when you don't feel like it, you will put off other things. It can happen slowly at first but it creeps further and further unless you put a stop to it. Eventually you will put off the hug that you friend needs, you will put off the good eating habits, you will put off the good score on a test, you will put off spending extra time with your kids later in life when you are a mother/father. After all, you don't feel like it, and/or it can wait. Now it is a habit, it gets ingrained in you, and you treat more of your life like that. Then you get older and you wish you had all that time back, and see how it would be so much better if only you wouldn't have been so lazy or undisciplined. Apply this with other behaviors or areas of your life, it can be sneaky. So if you generally apply discipline in your life and develop good habits, it can be a huge factor in providing a life you can look back on and be proud of, or just lead a fulfilling life. - Your reality is based on what you focus on. Learn to balance it, but also give certain areas of your life its due. I could write a lot on this. If you focus on doing well in school, then you will probably adapt your behavior to do so. If you focus on having a good time, then you will probably do so. If you focus on how positive things are in your life, you will see things more positively. If you focus on how women treat men badly or vice versa, then that will be your reality, and on and on. It shapes your reality, so be smart in what you focus on, step back and think about it. - There is a difference between stress and focus. Focus should be a relaxed resolve. Stress is something different, and if there is stress it may be because you are having a hard time focusing. (and having to deal with those results too) - And if you really want to up your game, meditate. It is really about focusing your thinking and actions. It is practice that follows you in life. It is ok to think, but focusing your thinking, that is where your power lies. It is also a non-military way to develop discipline. - Change in yourself mostly occurs in baby steps not leaps.",0,0,1

cevxkd3,"Imagine you have a balloon. It's not inflated, just a balloon. On it, you draw a bunch of dots with a sharpie. As you inflate the balloon, the dots get farther and farther apart, since the balloon is expanding. No new material was created, the balloon is just stretching, with everything on it just floating farther apart. If a 2-dimentional being were to live on this balloon, he we would only see that things seem to be getting darter apart. He wouldn't see the ""balloon"" bit. Just a flat surfac where everything seems to be getting farther away from everything else. From this observation, he concludes that there isn't really any ""center"" of the universe (at least from his point of view), but rather is a closed surface, expanding to make it looks like the dots are getting farther away from each other. We can apply this to our perspective. What we think is that the very same thing is going on in our universe. Rather than be in a closed universe that gets bigger, we are in our equivalent of the balloon analogy, but just kicked up a spatial demension. An outside observer may see a 4-dimentional sphere, expanding like a balloon. Therefore, much like the man on the balloon, we can't perceive an ""end"" to the universe, since it is a closed surface. If we go straight in one direction, we will eventually come full circle and wind up back at the start. One way we could prove this is the case is if we could somehow observe ourselves through the other side of the universe, but that would never b possible because the speed if light is a limitation. However, that's just the current theory. We really don't know WTF is going on with the universe as a whole.",0,0,1

dk6nw58,"Okay, fair enough, that might be the case. English isn't my first language, this is a complicated topic and I wanted to be brief. Not necessarily a recipe for success. So to make it clear. If you go by the definition of ""extreme poverty"" someone living in the US would indeed have to be so poor that they only had $1.90 or less to spend per day. These $1.90 today buy you roughly as much as $1.25 would have in 2005 (with inflation you'd only get an increase to $1.60 or so, but it's different for food and shelter, so I'm going with the World Bank figure). As you have said that is indeed very, very little money. But it's indeed what more than a billion people on this planet have to make due with. And there's a reason that many of these people are suffering from malnutrition. Extreme poverty means that you only get very, very cheap sorts of food, and will likely end up with some sort of nutrients deficiency. From what I know about American prices you probably could buy ramen, rice or bread with enough calories to survive with a bit more than a dollar per day. Combine that with living under a bridge and you're indeed living in extreme poverty. Please don't think I'm saying that relative poverty (as measured by the US poverty line and other indices) didn't matter. It does. It curbs life expectancy be a decade, it destroys prospects for education and the social injustice puts a strain on society.

The enemy design also meant that the armored guys looked too similar to the regulars, which in the middle of combat caused problems. Also the camera was kinda bad as well, and there were many combat zones that just didn't have enough space to fight or had obstacles which again, broke the flow. Also while Baker did a really good joker, Batman wasn't very good himself. And a lot of the story felt forced, like ""we HAVE to include all these people and stuff in it"" forced.

c09ibos,"most of the detailed comments here will really help you if you try to implement their suggestions and even though they will sound like hard work, solving a problem in your life is never easy however, I would like to adress another aspect of your issue - the nervousness which seems to freeze you. I have had the same problem because I was much too scared of failing as if it was an event which will destroy my life. Each grade and exam became a burden and even if I studied for them I always was very excited and scared This was solved by a few things: - understand that if you go to school it is because you want to and because you like what you are learning - if this isn't true try to find a school more adapted to what you want (or even quitting, but don't do it lightly - too many jump the gun ) - try to go after things and subjects which interest you and concentrate especially hard on them - for the others allocate time to absorb enough material to have an idea (and so to pass) - don't try to study for a grade (as C or B) - instead try to have a certain level of understanding, or in more direct terms, a part of the material which seems more important to you - failure IS an option and this is very good thing - you are learning to advance in your life, not to get passing grades - if you fail in school it is the best playground to understand your strong and your weak points The first time I got a failing grade was a powerful blow for me - however it helped me to get rid of the fear of failing (nothing happened, the world didn't end, my friends laughed and encoureged me and life went on). Every time you have a problem with an exam try to understand why - you don't like the subject, it isn't explained correctly, you are missing necessary previous knowledge - or are just plain lazy. Address each problem as needed - if you don't need the subject study less or change it, get a study partner, get a better book / change teachers, ask someone to explain it to you etc. If it's the latter --- well, then you really need to go on a hike alone and discover what you want to do with your life. It may sound corny and old, but you aren't learning for learning's sake - either you are getting something from school or it is lost time and you would be better getting a job. Try to talk with somebody that knows you, is older and has passed through life (and school) - really listen to their advice. Many times I wish I could apply some of the lessons I learned to my life ten years ago, but everyone is different - a parent, older teacher or gradparent can give you the insight you need.

So I said, ""Basically, if you can't hit the lower notes, you sing the higher notes,"" to which he aggressively responded, ""What do you mean 'I can't hit those notes?'"" In this arrangement, the last line of the chorus was supposed to be Soprano and Alto only, but alas this tenor was singing it anyway, and thus I addressed him. Politely, I informed him that it wasn't his part, and I asked him not to sing it. I was met with an ""Are you in my section? Hmm, no.

Then how come they aren't also 'catty'? Men, on average, communicate with more open aggressiveness and competitiveness than women, and women express aggression more indirectly. This is perhaps due to differences in physical strength, or the fact that solid social networks are normally more important to women and can be delicate, or just testosterone and lack thereof.

c1f8njg,"I see you like to think about data as something tangible. I do too. For example, I don't like the way one learn Lambda Calculus in some schools. You know, by telling that Lambda is the only thing one needs to design anything. In a pure mathematical model, it's plain true. But in a real computer, the *behavior function* (the overall pure function which changes every time the system learns from the outer word) needs to be materialized in some way. The way one materializes it is actually a major concern, especially if you seek for persistence. A naive attempt would be to define the whole system behavior in a single flat source code file, like a ""behavior.lisp"" file raw-copied in some hard drive. This file would need to be revamped at each system iteration. Naive as I said. The current way to work consists in splitting behavior between read-only flat files on disk (software code and assets) and read/write boxes that one fills with mutable values (user data and various settings). The system behavior is consequently 90% hardwired and the remaining 10% is all about little boxes one fills up with inputs. My thoughts are about finding an ultimate way to store the behavior function of a running system. I want it to be fully plastic and self-indexed. At first, I intended to do yet another object database. But I eventually realized than replacing files by some sets of slot-value pairs (or entity-relation database, or labeled graphs or predicates) didn't fundamentally change anything except from a better data granularity. One still faces a dumb system which can't fetch and manipulate most of the information it owns. Because slot-values objects, relational database, labeled graphs, predicates, XML files, RDF and any existing data storages I've found out on Google are all based upon a single ancestor: the box/value meta-model, which is wrong. Why? It's all about *reification* i.e. making more things tangible for the system to work with. In a box/value based system, one could dedup and hashmap values, but one could not dedup boxes (because their content can't be shared between contexts) and one can't neither dedup nor hashmap a ""some value in some box"" information at all. This last one -relationship- is not *tangible* for the system. And yet, as I said before, this is where *meaning* resides as bits by themselves are meaningless. If you dismiss graphs but embrace arrow structures (which actually supersedes academic graphs), now you can query the system for such a relationship, like (color-&gt;yellow) and get all the contexts where this relationship is involved. Plus now, this relationship is a first class citizen. You can use it as a referee (an head) or a referrer (a queue) to build up meaningful information. Now computers can natively work on the *meaning* of the data they store. Actually I suppose it's what I find mind blowing.",0,0,1

c0mqxvd,"&gt;Okay, post has been up for like a minute and I already have a few ""because he really just wanted alcohol."" If that is true, then it really depresses me. I mean I thought that was just a myth or something. I figure that most people actually are in need of food and help, not just lying to try and get a drink. Oh well. I'll still offer the next guy food, if I have have the chance. My city (Atlanta, GA) has a vast network of homeless shelters and soup kitchens that cater to the homeless. I don't think Atlanta is unique at all in this. If you are hungry and you need to eat, then there is always somewhere you can go to get food. Whenever a homeless person asks me for money I simply point them in the direction of the nearest homeless shelter where they can get a free meal. They usually just ignore me after that and go after somebody else. If your city is anything like mine, then you can safely bet that the vast majority of people asking you for money do not want it for food. They want it for alcohol and drugs. It's not a myth, it's the sad truth. This is the reason why I get extremely annoyed at people who give money to beggars on the street. All you are doing is furthering the problem. I live downtown so I have to deal with these people asking me for stuff every single day of my life, and I'm sick and tired of it. Giving them cash is not going to help them. Donate to a local homeless shelter and point them in that direction if you really want to help. Unfortunately, most people just want to feel good about themselves for a bit instead of actually doing something to correct the problem. With that said, I have given money to homeless people who told me they needed booze. I'm not going to miss the few bucks and he's going to have an okay night because of it. I just want honesty.

She was able to pay for college working a minimum wage job as a waitress as she went. I graduated from a private university 4 years ago. I've paid 20000 so far and still owe 40000. That cost would have three times higher but, I got lots of scholarships and took as many gen ed as possible at a community college. Having the debt makes it impossible to ever take time off, and the payments are so high it is scary. Banks have made it impossible to put debt on hold or file for bankruptcy. Student loans are a sick way for the public a private sector to make money. Not to mention that the US is making it easy for companies to ship high paying tech jobs overseas, and then allowing those same companies to bring the products produced back to the US tax free. Bottom line is stay debt free if possible. If you can find a way to skip college it is worth it because the debt that comes attached with it will last for a very long time.",0,0,1

I don't want a row house and feel cramped and constantly on top of my neighbors. I grew up in a pretty rural area of NY and there was still tons to do and had half an acre of land. That's fine, different people have different priorities. I really like having community interaction, and public transit infrastructure, both things which generally require higher population densities than you find in suburbs or rural areas. When I lived in the UK I could walk or cycle to pretty much anywhere in town and easily take public transit to the edges of town. This was definitely not possible where I grew up in Canada and that was in a city with even larger population - most cities in North America are very spread out and force you to rely on a car. This as you mentioned has the advantage of allowing you more property and space but I think it's at the cost of community interaction that you lose by few pedestrians and poor public transit. &gt; And, no, health insurance is paid for by your employer if you have a decent job. Which leaves out a lot of Americans. &gt;My fiance works in IT and I work in games, both of our industries are known for having incredible benefits. Hell, I travel to the US to get medical care because it's cheaper for me. In The Netherlands (where we live now) there is no socialized health care. You have to pay out of pocket for monthly insurance, plus pay a really high deductible (minimum is 385euro - if you're an averagely healthy person you'll NEVER go over that - so I pay several hundred euro per month for insurance and still have to pay out of pocket to get some anti-biotics for strep throat once a year). With my US health insurance that I currently have (still covered by my father's insurance) we pay absolutely nothing for insurance, when I go to the doctor I pay.. nothing. When I get my yearly OBGYN checkup I pay.. nothing. When I get my monthly birth control I pay.. nothing. The UK system is much better, but much of Europe doesn't have true single payer health care. Yes, you're comparing to the Netherlands which has some of the highest health-care costs in the world. If you compare to France or the UK or Canada, it's suddenly a very different story. &gt; Yeah, sure the taxes might be higher than Canada based on the state, but they won't be higher than what we're paying now in NL. Plus we don't get any of those benefits of free health care, free education (I already have my university degree), or any welfare protection (my fiance had to give up those rights to get me my visa). I've also never seen a flight to go outside of the NL for 50euro. We were long distance for some time and I would fly Berlin - Amsterdam and the cheapest it ever was was 120euro all in. When I was living in the UK I could regularly get one way flights for 50 euro on Ryanair to Ireland or France. &gt; And as someone else pointed out, subdivisions are not where the majority of Americans live. They are very easy to avoid and most people who live in them do it for the convenience. My fiance and I are childfree, so we would actually rather not be in a family friendly neighborhood. Well, according to the census bureau, 53% of Americans live in suburbs, so the majority of Americans do. &gt; In fact, if you compared most of the new construction in The Netherlands to American subdivisions you'd see basically the same thing, but instead of free standing homes it's all row houses (which, imo, are really really horrible). That's fair enough, I've never travelled extensively in the Netherlands. I'm basing my comparisons off of France, Belgium, and primarily the UK (which also has suburbs and extensive row houses, but also much more pedestrian friendly cities). &gt; I see you say elsewhere you lived in Indiana and Southern CA.. terrible to base your entire view of a massive country with as much diversity as Europe on two locations. Sure, it's hard to get around the US if you don't have a car, but when you compare the size of it to most European countries, it's truly understandable. In major metropolitan areas like New York, Boston, Chicago, and even LA, you don't need a car and can rely on public transportation, taxis, and uber. I lived in Berlin for several years, I know that nowhere I live will ever match it in terms of public transport. But comparing where I live now (rural Netherlands), the layout of any American city would be far superior. There aren't even reliable buses in my current town. But that's the problem with blanket comparing infrastructures of two vastly different countries. Yes that's fair, though I don't believe comparing the size of the US as an excuse for a car is fair. Cities can still be designed compact and with public transit but they're made to be sprawling. A car is really essential for getting to places within the U.S. but cities should be designed for public transit and most american cities are not. Of course, we can only ever base our perceptions off of what we know and our personal experiences. My personal experiences in the US were with sprawling areas with horrible public transit that required a car and with lots and lots of suburbs. I paid higher taxes than when I lived in Canada and saw no benefits for them. I would probably enjoy my experience more in more urban areas. Where I lived in Europe I got to enjoy very pedestrian friendly cities, very low cost healthcare, great communities of people bustling with activity and excellent public transit. I'm know there are places in Europe that are not like that and vice versa in the U.S. but that was my personal experience. I also much prefer the general attitude towards work-life balance that I found when working in Europe (UK and Belgium) than the U.S. In the U.S. and in Canada I would regularly be in the office until 9pm along with everyone else. When I was leading a meeting that started running past 6pm in Belgium, people started to get up and say they would like to go home and pick it up again tomorrow - this was a shock to me the first time it happened. Of course this isn't universal either, there are exceptions, my friends working in Switzerland in Zurich for example work very long hours - but these are general trends I've noticed after working in several places on both continents. I will admit that people in North America are generally friendlier in day to day interactions. And there is more disposable income in North America. At the end of the day it depends on what your priorities are. If you have the chance to live in America and are happier there, that is great :) - I was happier in Europe.",0,0,1

Upon purchasing the suppressor, you will fill out the necessary paperwork to be sent to the BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives). A $200 check is sent along with the paperwork for the tax stamp that allows you to own the Title II weapon. The suppressor stays with the dealer until your approved paperwork is returned from the BATFE with your tax stamp attached. At that point you are allowed to take your suppressor home with you.

It's not actually what they believe. If you look at most votes in most states on giving any rights to gay people, they still go against equal rights.

de4dvzh,"But metaethics is a human construct; it is impossible to escape the fact that whatever we consider to exist as a concept alone is a figment of our own creation. Obviously anybody who chooses to spend their time studying the subject in depth is going to conclude the subject is valid and exists because they've spent a lot of time on it. Ethics whether meta- or not is something which has evolved just like any other trait because it helps us to reproduce more effectively - since it cannot exist outside of an evolved system the argument is entirely moot. &gt;The mistake you are making is saying that you are taking human nature as it is and saying this is how it ought to be. Of course human society in it's current form relies on animal agriculture. Since we did, in fact, develop animal agriculture, this is only trivially true. It would be just as accurate for a slave owner in antebellum America to say that their culture wouldn't be possible without slavery of humans. Again, this is trivially true and does nothing to actually address the moral legitimacy of the practice. Not really since slavery cannot be demonstrated as being *necessary* to reaching our current state, nor could it be demonstrated as necessary to reach our current state when it was in effect. It possibly accelerated development, but countries that practiced less or no slavery at all were and are not meaningfully backwards today. By contrast, societies which were unable to domesticate animals were consigned to the technological backwaters - there is no example of a society which did not exploit animals beyond some uncontacted tribes. Whether humans should live like those uncontacted tribes or not is a separate debate; if you want to go and live with them then I invite you to do so if it is more in line with your beliefs - though I would argue doing so is worthy of nomination for a Darwin award. &gt;We don't need to dive into this, but I'll point out that it's pretty ludicrous to think you are able to predict all of human history, absent animal agriculture. I don't need to because as already discussed, the only remaining examples of societies without animal agriculture are uncontacted tribes. I can only assume you didn't watch the videos I linked because if you had you would understand why that is. Societies like those of the native Americans were woefully behind Europeans and would have remained that way because industrial and technological progress is impossible without animal domestication - there is a reason tribes in areas where they are no large animals still live the same way as humans did 10,000 years ago.",0,0,1

It's comforting to be surrounded by like-minded individuals and to see that you are not the only one who is saddened or upset by the outcome of something. It's also a good place to share ideas and discuss ideology and begin organizing concrete steps to take to further your issue. As for why they can sometimes get violent, that an unfair stigma against protesting as a whole. There were almost no arrests or violence at the Woman's March in the US. South Korea, Romania and other countries have recently conducted massive protests with little to no violence. The goal of a protest is to demonstrate the power of numbers; the physical existence of a significant population who all believe similar things and are willing to assemble in defense of those ideals. What you *see* about protests and riots in the media isn't always the whole truth. Yes, there are protests that get out of control or simply had no control to begin with. Riots will break out when people are angry or upset, and certainly there will always be people who take advantage of an already unstable situation to cause chaos and destruction. One problem we have with destabilized protests and such is that often times once a small group begins to riot, the larger hive mind of the people will set in and more will follow suit. It's not an excuse, but it is a reason. The number of people who attend a protest *solely* for the purpose of trying to turn it violent or riotous is a very small minority. Large, conductive masses of people are always dangerous. We see violence at large concerts, stampedes at religious and tourist sights, over crowding and poor crowd control at football and soccer matches. Having that many living, breathing, emotional individuals in one place is going to come with a *lot* of consequences, and sometimes they can be violent or deadly. That doesn't mean that people who go out to protest or who organize protests do so with the end goal of violence and chaos, even the best laid plans can go awry.",0,0,1

I've had thirty surgeries, cancer, a quad bypass, had my heart stopped for three minutes, been shot and snakebit. I've seen my share. There have been times so low, that just considering the next day was something unpleasant. It was time for a mental change. I consider how interesting it is, even the small stuff, that you get to see and experience next. Here's some science: If what you have going on in your world has got you to the point of even considering suicide as a solution, then logic says you should absolutely get out of that spot, that place, that situation at *all* costs, and see if that doesn't bring you a new course for your life.

Indeed, it's an incredibly powerful club. According to Oxfam, a leading poverty-fighting organization, this relatively small sliver of the population holds a staggering 48% of the worldâ€™s wealth.

Over the course of the ACA, it became clear that while there more patients had insurance, reimbursements were tanking. As uncertainty over the future of the ACA rose, people stopped electing to have outpatient procedures-- the kind of thing you can delay. Reimbursements are still tanking. So outpatient revenues are tanking. Most people sick enough to be inpatients are still coming to the hospital, but again reimbursements for these patients are low. It is a very uncertain time and now we're going through a second round of what we did when the ACA was just getting started. We've eaten up that operating margin we built up and now have to cut spending once again, with even less $$ coming in. Oversimplified but that's the gist.

cenzz49,"I went to see the New York Islanders a couple of weeks ago, and one of my lifelong goals was realized during the first intermission. After the Zamboni worked its rejuvenating magic to the rink, the Ice Girls skated out armed with their t-shirt guns. Even though I donâ€™t want to look overeager, I always stand up, ready for that infinitesimal chance that a t-shirt might be launched my way. Everyone wants a free t-shirt. I donâ€™t know why the Islanders donâ€™t just give out free t-shirts with the price of every ticket. â€œWelcome to the Nassau County Coliseum,â€ theyâ€™d usher you inside after a vigorous pat-down, â€œHereâ€™s your free t-shirt.â€ Ticket sales would be up at every home game, I guarantee it. But then I guess if everybody got a free t-shirt, I wouldnâ€™t be feeling as special as Iâ€™m feeling right now. Yep, thatâ€™s right, I caught a free t-shirt. It finally happened for me. Never again am I going to come home from a game, staring at my shirtless torso in the mirror, forced only to dream of what Iâ€™d look like if only I were draped in an XL, one-size-fits-most one hundred percent white cotton tee, the New York Islanders logo screen printed on the front, an advertisement for the Roslyn Savings Bank displayed even larger on the reverse side. But Iâ€™m getting way ahead of myself. We got to the Coliseum and I hurried through my pre-game routine. To be honest, free t-shirts werenâ€™t really even on my mind. Iâ€™m not even sure hockey was at the forefront yet. First things first: the fifty-fifty. As far as I know, the Nassau Coliseum is the only place outside of a senior citizensâ€™ church bingo luncheon that regularly holds a fifty-fifty. And I donâ€™t understand why the fifty-fifty isnâ€™t more common, because its allure is universal. Everybody put in some money, and weâ€™ll pick one of you to win half of the total. Itâ€™s so simple, itâ€™s genius. No gimmicks, no games. Besides going to a Seven-Eleven, buying a bunch of scratch-offs, and having the guy behind the register immediately scan the barcodes without you having even done any scratching, the fifty-fifty is about the closest you can get to straight gambling. Itâ€™s like freebasing, but on a stadium-wide level. After that, Iâ€™ve got to swing by either Gate 7 or 15 to buy my chance to play Chuck-a-Puck. Itâ€™s another Islanders game staple. For ten bucks, you get a bag of five orange foam hockey pucks. Right after the second period ends, they put this giant bulls eye in the center of the ice. You then chuck your puck, and the closest to the middle gets a cash prize. Fifty-fifty, check, Chuck-a-Puck, check, now all I needed was a hotdog, a pretzel, a churro, and a large Mountain Dew, and Iâ€™d be ready to watch some hockey. The Islanders were playing the Dallas Stars, and by the end of the first period, I had all but forgotten about the t-shirt guns. And boy was I happy when I saw them being locked and loaded. I needed some positivity. We all did. It wasnâ€™t a good start to the game. The Stars scored almost immediately, and then the Islesâ€™ goalie Evgeni Nabokov hurt his groin. Upon replacing Nabby in net, backup goalie Kevin Poulin broke in his pads by letting up another goal almost instantly. At the end of the first, it was 2-0 Dallas. I almost didnâ€™t even feel like standing up for the Ice Girls. Maybe if I hadnâ€™t just watched one of the worst first periods in NHL history, Iâ€™d be more enthusiastic about waving my hands in the air for a t-shirt that was unlikely to hit my direction. But something inside pulled me to my feet, and then I saw one of the Ice Girls aim in my direction. Boom! The t-shirt arched in the air and, right before I reached out my hand, time seemed to freeze beside me, like I could see this thing hovering right in front of my face. I looked around, all of the other fans jumping and reaching my way. But I didnâ€™t even have to compete. It was as simple as extending my left arm and welcoming it into my open palm. The guy sitting to my right gave me a high-five and told me, â€œAwesome grab man!â€ and for a few minutes, I was stunned, like did this really just happen? Did, after twenty-five years of attending New York Islanders games, did I just effortlessly catch a free t-shirt from an Ice Girl? I canâ€™t say for sure that my good fortune had anything to do with what happened next, but going into the second period, the Islanders immediately turned things around. Where the mood just moments before was grim, a current of positively charged energy jolted the crowd to its feet as the home team scored one, then two goals to tie the game, then a third one to secure the lead. As the final seconds of the game ticked by, the Isles wound up crushing the Stars with a final score of 7-4. It was everything I could have wanted out of hockey game. You know, besides winning the fifty-fifty or the Chuck-a-Puck. And also, they were out of churros. But itâ€™s OK, I had some Dippinâ€™ Dots instead. Captain John Tavares scored a hat trick. Iâ€™d never seen one outside of a video game. The fans actually threw hats, it was awesome! And I won a free t-shirt. My very own free New York Islanders t-shirt. My wife looked at it and said, â€œWhen are you going to wear an extra large t-shirt?â€ And I just laughed to myself, I thought, â€œHa. When am I not going to wear it?â€ Because seriously, Iâ€™m never taking this thing off. Iâ€™ll wear it forever. Iâ€™m wearing it right now. And it didnâ€™t cost me anything. I won it. It was free.",0,0,1

dc8bpbt,"I say this all from personal experience, sadly :( High school and college (I'm in the UK, so HS finished at 16, college at 18 then uni at 21) were both pretty good. Any problems I had, which were minimal at the time, were nipped in the bud pretty quick. Any bullying was stopped. I felt good because I had friends at the time, I didn't have any unhappiness at all. Just the typical heartbreak a few times which I got over. And I was successful, mostly a straight-A student throughout. My problems began in uni mostly. I got into bad relationships, I became depressed, began cutting, and my grades suffered the most, I struggled. I didn't have many friends either as most from school/college had gone off to do their own thing and hadn't remained in touch with me. Everything changed pretty much. Uni is an experience I'd rather forget. My parents didn't help me at all, just berated and verbally abused me for being 'over dramatic' because 'I play games and talk to boys online all day long instead of working'. True I didn't do much work but I was doing other things that I did not want to share with them - normal things I was afraid of sharing because of their behaviour. My grades suffered to the point that my personal advisor (everyone was assigned one in uni) wanted to speak with me. This was in my final year, when I was juggling uni, my job, volunteering work, a breakup and a court case that had popped up for my mum. I needed to speak to her anyway because she was the lecturer for a subject I'd failed in my first year, which I was going to retake and I needed tips. Well firstly she screamed at me for not attending classes, I tried to explain my depression but she wasn't having any of it. I remember I couldn't attend one class because there'd been flooding, trains were cancelled, my parents were at work, and I don't drive. The only option was to shell out an obscene amount of money for a taxi to uni (90 minutes each way) which I couldn't afford. Her response? 'well that's not an excuse you should have attended'. She almost barred me from taking my first semester exams, on the basis that 'we don't give out degrees to people like you who don't attend class' and that I'd have to give her medical proof of my depression if I wanted to take my exams. Then she goes 'yeah what else do you want then?' and I said I needed tips for the exam I was retaking. 'Just read the textbook a new one has come out' and that was it. I think she might have thrown something at me I don't remember Luckily, she was away for 5 weeks around the exam period and the lady assigned to me in her place said I'd be taking exams UNLESS I had proof I couldn't due to depression... and I did fail that exam I retook, I then had to spent nearly Â£1k taking another course to make up for that exam. Other than that 1 exam I did ok in uni, not brilliant but ok to scrape by I suppose. It'd have been better if I had supportive teachers and parents. I don't ask for support anymore for this reason. In comparison I've been going through a similar thing at my current uni (post-grad). Missed classes etc due to depression and an ongoing legal battle with my neighbours.

She was asking if something was ready yet (don't remember what, but based on the way she asked and the nurse's actions, it wasn't important, not like pain meds or something). The nurse would say it wasn't and she had to wait, usually took a few minutes to answer the same 'why not'/similar questions, and then say she'd have to leave to check other patients. Call light comes on again like clockwork, exact same scenario except the nurse getting more frustrated each time. I don't know if they muted her light, disconnected it, or what, but eventually the call light stopped and the lady turned to just calling out 'nurrrrssseeeee?' in a pitiful old-lady squeak-whine.

ch6rxfi,"1. Again, infinitely long series doesn't mean that there's some weird infinity-based number tacked on at the end. nth term has n digits (messed up that part, n digits not n-1), and since there is no infinitely long integer, there is no infinitely long term in that series similar argument as why there is no infinitely long integer actually) 2. I feel like you don't get the concepts of limits/arbitrarily small/arbitrarily large if you're making this argument. Idk what to tell you, other than offering to mail you some of my old textbooks. I'm not going to bother arguing this part anymore because what you're saying doesn't really make sense/apply in any way. 3. Of course 1/infinity isn't 0. That's why we either discuss things in terms of their limits, or in terms of arbitrarily small numbers. Because 1/infinity is not a real number. (In most cases where you write 1/infinity, it should be the limit of 1/n as n approaches infinity, but I try to read past the faulty math). And if you think you can multiply 1/infinity, then you can definitely divide 1/infinity. k x infinity, k&gt;0, k being a real number, =infinity. So, 2/infinity=1/(2 x infinity)=1/infinity=1/(infinity/2)=(1/2)/infinity=1/infinity. (If you don't like this argument, you can just remember that a fraction of fractions works mathematically, so its (1/2)/infinity, which is obviously the same as 1/infinity.) And this is why your weird infinity arithmetic argument makes no sense. As for the later part, that's me proving that there is no ""smallest number greater than x"". Because we work with real numbers when we talk about things like this, 1/infinity isn't a thing there. and when you try to just set it arbitrarily small, we can always find a smaller number. So, there is no smallest number greater than 1. Try to write a proof without using infinity arithmetic, which makes no sense in real numbers, and you'll see you're wrong.",0,0,1

It seems like your group sounds pretty fair and levelheaded and i can respect that. I think what killed it for me early on was how forced it came, you're right, the Books we were given contradicted each other not only within other books, but something came wrong to me as a kid. If something is true, you make a theory and then when you explore it, you find more evidence to support it as you go through life if it turns out true. People believed in faith healing, that's what i did to. I had a close friend who had a dying father who was suffering from 'sickness' (lung cancer') and they made us all pray together and fast for a week to faith heal him. I believed it would help. They sent other stories of missionaries going out and motivational stories of poor starving widows in 3rd world countries being converted to spend the last dollars they would have spent on medicine to cure their children instead on tithing and blessings. Instead of acknowledging that perhaps it couldn't work, they admonished us instead for being ""too weak in faith to work miracles"". And that's when things started falling apart, chink by chink for me. It never made sense to me that if a god really did exist, he'd go out to publish a book for millions to read, but would refuse to show any proof of existence. And then thousands of years later, go forth to send a man on a ship to bury the 2nd book. Perhaps i can see a strong case for religions standing out as personal beliefs and culture out in the sense of tradition, much akin to the culture of the Hawaiians and Amish. But as for a literal interpretation of a magical, RPGish priest who can heal cancer and wounds, life's blunt cycle has left me jaded. It just doesn't work for me, i would much rather cling onto the idea that perhaps we were just put onto the world to live and perhaps not having a god in my eye is a terrible thing. I think it'd be much worse imaging a universe where a being that was supposed to be the all good had the potential to save you, decide to let someone die instead for not liking him enough.

c1fzg2u,"I don't think that it's like that. Just as there are shallow men, there are also shallow women as well. An equal amount of them in both genders across all ages, I'll bet. When we date, especially online dating, we tend to shop around for men/women who have the entire package, a completely unique package which is based on a list of desires - some that are wants, and some that are needs. When we start dating someone we observe carefully for the things that we desire. We may think, for example, ""He's got a great smile, he's funny, and he's a gentleman, but I guided the conversation. Is that just nerves or is he not interested in me?"" So say you don't go on another date with him, but you date around for months and then dating gets frustrating and now you're less optimistic about dating and so you lower your standards, but you don't want to because we are told as a society not to settle, but also not to be too picky. So I think that sometimes we hold onto shallow preferences that may not matter as much to one person as it does to another. For example, her dedication to working out may change if later down the road her job or children busy her schedule, but yes, if this is something you admire, it can make for a great way to spend time together and exercise. It just can't be the primary reason you are attracted to her, there has to be a deeper connection. But I also think we are all human beings who are entitled to our attractions, whatever that may be. I think that is healthy as long as there is also a deeper connection the relationship beyond this. This is why I think it's dumb when people get worked up when they get rejected. No, their reasoning may not be justified, or maybe yes, it could be justified, but this rejection is not an indicator of what your self-worth should be, nor will it matter when you've met the love of your life. This is just an opinion of an young woman who has dated, is in a wonderful relationship, and has observed/given advice/been a shoulder to cry on for my parents and friends in the dating scene.

djia1es,"I now have 16 years history of battling depression and eating disorders. It only started getting better when I received professional help about 5 years ago (meds, personal and group therapy). I have a few pieces of advice that really worked for me: * Seek help. If you can't afford therapy, read about it, talk to someone and generally, don't think that the thoughts and anxiety will just go away. It won't. Your best defense is facts, techniques and knowledge of how common and normal these things really are. Check your medical insurance. I accidentally found out that they covered therapy sessions as well, but only after a friend with the same insurance told me. They might not be advertised very much. * Accept the fact that it will be a long fight. If I look back at the last five years, my life has improved unbelievably. But there has been days and weeks when all I could do was cry, lay in bed, eat and purge. There will be downs, but congratulate yourself on each day, hour or situation that you handled well and use those days to define yourself rather than the bad ones. You are a strong, recovering person that occasionally has a bad day. Get that into your head! * Accept the fact that it is part of you. One of my favorite techniques is welcoming negative thoughts as an old, annoying relative that always rambles insults on everyone, that you still love somewhat because it is family, but don't pay too much attention to. If I catch myself caught in the middle of thoughts about how I am a fat failure, I just stop, smile and say ""oh here you are, haven't heard from you in a while. What should we do today to calm you down - wanna go for a walk? See a movie? Wanna go through my ten best memories this month?"". I sometimes even say it out loud. Always with a smile. Somehow it's hard to be serious with self-hating after that. * Take pride in your fight. The society is not completely there yet to congratulate people that are successfully fighting mental illness. You get plenty of praise for cancer survivors, people who push through with chronic diseases. You are a fighter as well and deserve the same pride in yourself. You did not choose your illness, so don't apologize for it. * Make a choice to get better. Don't read this as ""ah, just get yourself together"". But through my group therapy and later in life I have encountered many people who somehow masochistically enjoy having mental disorders. It becomes part of their identity, and excuse for their unused potential. They find comfort in talking about it, identifying with it. I was like that in my early 20s when I saw my eating disorder as a sign of strong-will and control. Took some time to realize that it was controlling me and not the other way around. Be honest with yourself and once you are ready to get out, start the long, proud journey, one day at the time. Trust me, it will get better once you have more experience. My main inspiration to keep fighting is reflecting on the progress I already made. I will probably never be completely free from my mental disorders. But I am not afraid of them anymore, because I know that I will recognize and neutralize them in very early stages due to my will to fight and all the skills I gathered through the years.",0,0,1

c0j0b2s,"A little late to the thread, but anyways. When I was nearing the end of my 7th grade year, my father was riding a recumbent bike down a bridge on a nearby trail. He still does not know to this day why, but he was wearing just a hat rather than his normal helmet. He is the type of person that always wear his seat belt, always make my brother and I wear our helmets, and he would always try to set the example to wear them as well. While he was going down a bridge his hat flew off and he remembers turning to catch it, being the heavyset guy that he was and still is today he tipped over in the bike and landed head first, luckily there had been a person he was riding with that saw this all happen and was able to call for help immediately. After being flown to the hospital he had very little signs of possible recovery. He was in a coma and after a week to two weeks the doctors were telling us that there is very little chance of him making it out of the coma, and that even if he made it out that he would most likely have very little memory of who we were or how to do basic functions. He woke up after about two to three weeks of being in his coma. He was unable to walk, eat solids, and many more things. He changed drastically after the coma, which is expected from a person that was bipolar having serious head trauma. He recovered after a few months of different types of therapy. After ""recovery"" his only recollections of his coma was that he said that he could actually hear us and be able to tell that we were there visiting him and that he had no control over getting up. We remember still that if we would squeeze his hand he would squeeze back, not hard but it was always nice to know he was there somewhere. He's a completely different person now after the brain injury. It's hard to realize someone you knew so well could change just from one decision. He recognizes it too, and he truly regrets not wearing a helmet.

As I was wondering through one of the towns along the coast as a relatively fresh spawn, trying to meet up with my friend, we agreed to meet on a hill just outside the town I was in. But then I spot a frankly ridiculous number of zombies in a cluster. All I have is a hatchet, but I've already been spotted. So I do the obvious thing and run. My friend is already atop the hill overlooking the town, and is laughing as I bolt out of the city, followed by a swarm of zombies, picking up more and more as I blaze along. By the time I reach foot of the hill, its clear that we aren't going to get out of this one easily. But then we heard the familiar chugging sound of helicopter blades. We thought it was surely the end, as the pilot and his friends would surely pick us off for fun. As the swarm of zombies ascend the hill, the helicopter begins to lower nearby, and then I heard the single best thing that I've ever heard in an online game. A commanding voice from the helicopter bellows ""Get in if you want to live!"" Of course we run to the helicopter, climb in, and it turns out that the pilot is very friendly. He's heading to his friends, and agrees to drop us off to a military base on the way so that we can properly equip ourselves. Good times.

Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a cropâ€”some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.â€",0,0,1
dg6a1kd,"As someone who has done research into financial mathematics, I cannot say anything that DrMonkeyLove hasn't said already. Except when he says ""If you're on the young side, you should take more risk. If you're close to retirement, then lean toward bonds and other safe investment."" I'd like to expand on that and clarify the following: If you are planning to retire at 60 (pretty standard in the US of A, not sure where you live) and are currently 20 years old you should invest 60% of the money you plan on investing in high risk, high reward scenarios (like say, stock market index funds). Over a 40 year period, like say the time from age 20 to 60, you only have a 3% chance of losing money on stocks, and the 40% of your money you invest in bonds should more than cover the potential loss (if you don't get why this works, learn about expected values). If you are currently 40 you should invest 40% of the money that you plan on investing in stock index funds. If you are currently 60, then a mere 20% of money that you invest should be in stock index funds while the rest should be in bonds and other easily accessible manners (like CDs or {as much as I hate to say it} savings accounts). This investment helps you earn on your money, as opposed to basically letting it rot in a checking account. Even if you have no clue what an index fund is, I recommend, like DrMonkeyLove, looking into Vanguard, as their fees are significantly less than those of something like eTrade, and are not nearly up to the gains that I am 99% sure you could make. Also, I can pull up an exact chart that correlates age to percentages in each category of investment if you would like. Theoretically you should be re-balancing your portfolio every 6 months or year to maximize the amount of money you can earn utilizing this substantial sum.",0,0,1

If you can convince them, they begin to feel that they believe the ""real truth"", and that others are the ones who are easily mislead. It kind of gives them a boost in their own self worth.

They were the parents, I was their child, they paid the bills, it was their job to try to teach me what they thought life was all about. In fact, even though I decided later on that I disagree with much of what they taught, going to church every Sunday at least gave me an appreciation for spiritual questions.

dgoy14t,"I originally went to school to be a teacher but after a couple of long term sub assignments, parents were the main reason I realized teaching wasn't for me. My favorite memory was of one particular woman with a son named Kyle. I had a two month assignment in for a sixth grade class. Sometimes, when they had a silent work period, I would quietly put music on. The kids loved it and often asked if I could play certain songs. It started to become a treat/prize that I would reward them with. I found an instrumental version of one of Eminem's songs. The kids often asked for me to play stuff by him but I wasn't comfortable even with the radio version. I figured the instrumental was fine. I was wrong. Kyle's mother heard him singing the song one evening. She came in the next day and yelled at the principal that I was playing ""the devil's music"" in my classroom and teaching the kids swear words. When I explained to her there were no words and that he must have heard them somewhere else outside of school she said it wasn't possible and that I was lying. The principal decided the kids shouldn't listen to anything but classical after that point. Unfortunately this was near the beginning of my assignment and before the two months were up I had met with Kyle's mom three other times: Kyle wouldn't be doing his science project because they were going on a cruise, I was giving too much homework and why were the kids expected to read the book for their book report outside of school.

cgnso94,"From another thread on *Hurt:* &gt;I'm not a musician, and I'm not going to address which version is better from a technical standpoint. But the reason people relate to the Cash version is because his voice is cracked with age. Johnny Cash lived a long life filled with remarkable pain. His regret, addiction, shame, and suffering are all extremely evident in this song, more so in the video. &gt;The video was recorded seven months before he died. It features shots from throughout his 50 year career, most of them hollow rather than triumphant. The old house he visits was his home for 30 years. It burned down soon after. The museum of his career featured in the video had been closed and derelict for many years, a stark reminder of his personal and professional mortality. At several points in the video, his wife June Carter looks on from a short distance. She was dead four months later. &gt;Johnny Cash is old and twisted in the video. He had endured a botched jaw surgery several years before that left him in sharp, constant pain. He declined medication for this because it could have re-triggered his well-known addiction. &gt;Johnny Cash knew he was nearing the end of his life. His fame had faded. He'd accomplished a lot in his life, but none of it could bring his brother back from the dead, win the approval of his father, erase his numerous public mistakes, ease the suffering of his friends or keep his wife by his side much longer. All of his success couldn't save him from the pain he'd inflicted on others or felt himself. What did he have to show for his life? An empire of dirt. &gt;After June Carter died, Johnny Cash recorded 60 more songs before dying himself four months later. That's the last thing June told him to do: keep working. Sometimes he would breakdown and howl with sorrow for his dead wife, then keep right on playing. The material he produced at the end of his life is absolutely haunting. &gt;Here was one of the best known musicians of the 20th century, his face and body twisted and broken. His voice failing him. He sang like a runner at the end of a marathon: shattered and exhausted, racing towards the end so the pain would stop. &gt;That's why people, including Trent Reznor, are haunted by the Cash version of the song. It may have been stripped down from a musical stand point, but rarely has anyone managed to convey that amount of pain and regret in four short minutes. Trent Reznor recorded that song in his twenties with his whole career ahead of him. Cash's version is the opposite: This is it. This is the end. No more redemption. &gt;TLDR: Johnny Cash's version resonates because that man HURT.",0,0,1

deu9wb5,"I agree completely with the idea that you can know a lot of people and have but a few real friends. I also only have a few people that I would honestly consider a friend. These people are those with whom I am willing to invest my time and trust. These people are also those who have shown me that they are aware of what it actually means to be a friend and ignore whatever might come from even others they consider to be friends. When we recognize who we are and find some level of comfort and confidence only then can we really start to see how others are. I think that's one thing I recognized with this friend. Although they are extremely confident in a lot of what they did, this one area seemed particularly sensitive. There could be any number of reasons why it was such an issue, but it seemed like it took someone who was willing to be genuinely who they were to allow for that insecurity to manifest into a request that boiled down to ""please, stop being who you are as much."" In reality, that request is somewhat ridiculous, but it demonstrates the struggle the friend had with handling someone not only being who they were but expressing what it really means to be a friend. They couldn't understand how someone could express appreciation without having an ulterior motive because they had not really ever had that experience previously. That's honestly even sad now to think about because nobody should be put in a position where simple gratitude is viewed as an area where change is required. People do have a choice, and often people are so afraid of the choice that they allow others to give influence. At some point we all have to recognize we'll eventually be left to make our own choices and face the outcome of the choices we've allowed others to make on our behalf. It also now makes me think what happens when this friend eventually goes off and gets into a more serious relationship like marriage? What kind of compromise of the other person will be requested when the situation is a lot more intimate? I guess I feel like maybe I should have put more time into discovering the ""why"" so that I might have been able to help this person start to come to terms with how this insecurity was controlling their life.",0,0,1

Rather than blood quantum we base membership on three things - ancestry, self-definition, and community acceptance.

There was one reaction (to the placebo, in a self-identified MSG-sensitive individual). &gt;Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) has extensively documented MSG.[Gov. 7] The FSANZ MSG technical report concludes, ""There is no convincing evidence that MSG is a significant factor in causing systemic reactions resulting in severe illness or mortality. The studies conducted to date on Chinese Restaurant Syndrome (CRS) have largely failed to demonstrate a causal association with MSG. Symptoms resembling those of CRS may be provoked in a clinical setting in small numbers of individuals by the administration of large doses of MSG without food. However, such effects are neither persistent nor serious and are likely to be attenuated when MSG is consumed with food. In terms of more serious adverse effects such as the triggering of bronchospasm in asthmatic individuals, the evidence does not indicate that MSG is a significant trigger factor.""[Gov. 8] MSG also occurs naturally in many foods like fruit and more specifically: * tomatoes * potatoes * grapes * cheeses * mushrooms Does your mother get a headache when eating these things too and do you think she might start to if you told her plain mashed potatoes had msg in them?

dgi2hr5,"Me and a couple of friends were heading back from a weekend trip, going along the motorway approximately 70mph with several cars around us going about the same speed. We were in the lane closest to the barrier and it was late. I don't remember the time but it was dark enough that we didn't see the stag until about five second before we hit it. We clipped the front half of it because the stag was stood between the middle lane and our lane. We couldn't stop to check on it, there were no lights, we were travelling close to 70mph and there were several cars behind us, we had to keep going. Over the next forty minutes some of us made awkward nervous comments because none of us really knew how to react. Especially when we realised that what had happened was by no means a 'win' but it was the the best possible outcome for us. If we'd turned one way to avoid it we'd have struck the body of the stag instead as well as the car beside us and probably cause a pile up with the cars behind us. Had we turned the other way, the car would have hit the central barrier at 70mph and at best we'd be injured and the people behind us caught unawares, at worst we could have died. The next day someone was giving me a lift to the station and even sat in a different car, all I could hear was the thud as it hit us.

I have a buddy I play with a lot that is prone to not roating, but he's a god at being able to clutch near the net by himself, so I'll tend to know my place on the field, go back a little to mid field (in case I need to revert to being goalie , or clean up a pass he makes for me). Or, if I'm playing solo in 2s or 3s I know to play more defensice at beginning of game to see how the teammates are. If I see the are rotating I will find the correct groove. Rotating is all about knowing where your teammates are and trying to predict what and where they will be. Even try to learn quickly how the other team is. If they're trying to set up aerials most of everytime they have ball control on your side of the map, make sure there is a goalie at all times then. If you find nobody on your team is in net, then get there. My favorotire rotation in 3s is where everyobdy always has boost. If the ball is on opponents side, and I go up for a goal attempt I'll generally use most of my boost. If I don't goal, and ball is still in our control on their side of the map, the idea is I'll rotate back to mid/back field to get boost and the other teammate that was already back there will push forward taking my position. So, idea 3s rotation is , while in offense mode, 2 cars are trying to goal, and there is 1 guy somewhere in midfield ready to either go back to goal to be goalie, or take the place of one of the cars who wants to rotate out for more boost (that car would take the mid-field position) A ball chaser is somebody who doesn't rotate and is always in offesnse mode. They would be trying to goal, run out of boost, go mid field to get boost, then go right back to trying to goal instead of reading that the other teammate had taken their spot and not going to mid.",0,0,1

She was cut of from the conversation and was confused, looking at her phone she asked me why I was calling her, but I didn't have my phone in my possession and it was an outgoing call.

I just commented elsewhere in this thread but the following excerpt from America's Constition: A Biography by Akhil Reed Amar (which references the two federalist papers in questions) directly contradicts this arugment. &gt; Indeed, the Constitution expressly charged states with ""the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress."" While these militias, which would later figure prominently in the Second Amendment, were ultimately subject to nationalization in times of emergency, their loyalties were likely to be local. State governments would train these men, equip them, and appoint their officers. If central authorities tried to use a national standing army to suspend the Constitution and subjugate the people, state militias could spring into action, much as colonial governments had mobilized military resistance to George III in the mid-1770s. &gt;In a pair of Federalist essays penned separately by Hamilton and Madison, Publius elaborated the argument that, in the highly improbable scenario of a national military despotism run amok, states could ride to the rescue [...] ""if the persons entrusted with supreme power become usurpers, the different parcels, subdivisions, or districts of which it consists, having no distinct government in each, can take no regular measures for defense. The citizens must rush tumultuously to arms, without concert, without system, without resource."" But in the united States, a very different scenario could unfold. Should tyrannous national leaders attempt a military coup d'etat, ""the state governments, with the people on their side, would be able to repel the danger.... [The standing army] would be opposed [by] a militia amounting to near half a million of citizens with arms in their hands, officered by men chosen from among themselves, fighting for their common liberties, and united and conducted by governments possessing their affections and confidence.... Local governments ... could collect the national will and direct the national force.""",0,0,1

Consider the following: 1.Would your life benefit from some new activities, hobbies, interests? That helps the boredom problem. 2. Could you make them social activities, with new friends and contacts? That eases the emotional stuff, as you become more ""outward focussed"". Also, being socially involved tends to make you care more about how you look, thus the incentive to stop pigging. The connections between overeating, boredom and emotional stress are circular.

You get the 2% cash back ($750 annual max cash back), and if it doesn't spend the ~$3k/year to make up the difference at the end of the membership year you can request a refund and they will downgrade you back to gold and refund the difference.

Off the top of my head I can say that the in the before Napster era, pretty much any given release would make back costs(1) and between 10% to 50% returns above primary costs(2). I could pretty much always sell out a first run of 1,000 units within a couple months and got re-orders on about half my releases to do another 1,000 units. Any money made went into funding the next release or sometimes to help out a band or artist who was tight on cash (at least 8 out of 10 musicians cant manage money to save their lives). Post Napster sales started just breaking even, manufacturing runs started getting smaller. After torrents got popular it is pretty much impossible to even recoup primary costs and now *everything* is done work for hire because there is no money left to pay royalties. My last few releases were 300~500 units which was the most my distributor would take and pay COD. I got paid *exactly* what it cost me to manufacture so I lost money on shipping. The current window of sales is 7 days. Retailers are ordering a *maximum* of 15 copies of any new release because they know the sales window and dont want to be stuck with unsold merchandise. There are no more re-orders or represses. I stopped doing CDs a few years ago because no retailer wants to touch them any more. I am signed up with various digital sales outlets and the income is not making up the money lost and very far from even covering recording costs. Yes I own my own digital studio now but there are still running costs. All that said, without piracy like it is today, I might actually make some money. Now I barely see the point in doing new releases. 1. Tape, any equipment I had to rent, any studio musicians I had to hire, mastering, vinyl pressing or cassette duplication (CDs were still very expensive for runs under 10,000 back then so out of my range), shipping, losses due to distributors or retailers not paying for what they received or not shipping back unsold stock, etc. 2. things like maintaining my studio equipment, taking out an actual ad in a relevant small magazine or fanzine for the genre, paying to print up t-shirts/stickers or other merch/promotional items, etc. Royalties would come out of this slice of the pie as well but studio musicians were work for hire so they got their money up front as per the contract.",0,0,1

Now to make a number in between them, you take their difference, divide it in half and add it to the smaller number. So 2.5 is between 2 and 3, and 2.45 is between 2.4 and 2.5. Furthermore, to claim that there are an infinite amount of numbers, you could divide the difference in half twice, or three times, up to an infinite number of times and add this to the smaller number. So 2.25, 2.125, 2.1, 2.01, 2.0000001, etc. are all in between 2 and 3. Now to bring this back to the original problem: what is 1 - 0.999999... = 0.0000000... There is no difference.

cfn7lvo,"This is a big problem for a lot of people, because it's the sort of behavior that's protective when we're growing up but maladaptive when we're adults. You might want to look into Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (but ask a therapist, since I'm not a doctor or anything). Check with your school to see what sort of options are available to students. Hopefully there will be something, as this problem is *really* common among high-functioning people. At its core CBT is about identifying the automatic thoughts our brain throws up as part of its distorted view of reality, and then reframing our interpretation of a given situation with something more in line with reality. For example, I was afraid to talk to a girl at a bar because I thought my friends would see me make a fool out of myself and think less of me. In that situation I was reading the minds of my friends, and making the whole situation seem doomed from the start. More likely than anything, my friends didn't care *that* much about what I was doing, and that the anxiety I felt was mostly endogenous. **You can start by reading this [list of cognitive errors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_distortion), or taking this [quiz](http://cmhc.utexas.edu/stressrecess/animations/quiz/quiz-distortions.swf) which illustrates its application.** If this sounds like something you do, or sounds like it might be helpful to your situation, **I'd check out [Feeling Good by David Burns](http://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-Therapy-Revised-Updated/dp/0380810336/).** You can probably find it for $5 or less at a used bookstore. It's a more comprehensive and step by step guide through CBT. It describes the cognitive distortions, has quizzes and exercises to help you apply them, and covers a variety of different manifestations of anxiety. **Lastly, and most importantly, allow yourself to take time with this process.** It won't be overnight, nor will it be fixed in a year. You'll make extraordinary improvement, for sure, but it's not a switch that you can turn off. Remember that these thought patterns are part of how your brain has functioned all its life. It is what powers perfectionists but gives them palladium poisoning at the end of the day. For me it was a source of undue stress to kick myself for not thinking ""perfectly"" quickly enough. It's a slow process that you may need help with, but you can do it. Good luck!",0,0,1

c09nwec,"You should certainly set her free, but not necessarily to date other people, but instead set her free from your own expectations so she can negotiate the end of your life in the manner that she would like to. If that means staying steadfastly by your side then you should consider that, too, before making any decisions. One tip that a friend of mine gave me during my parents' terminal illnesses was not to grieve too soon (they both died of cancer, my mother before my father). His advice was based on seeing his sister through her cancer. Now, his advice was not literally correct, in that the grieving process does and should begin in advance of an impending loss. This is healthy and natural. But what he meant was that you should not despair too soon, or let the loss coming sometime in your future rob you of happiness today. If you have not, please read up on [Kubler-Ross' five stages of grieving](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model). What you are going through now is bargaining, that is trying to negotiate control over something to compensate for the very natural feelings of lack of control. There's nothing wrong with your negotiating. As with all aspects of grief, it's normal to feel it, so I am not saying you shouldn't go through this mental exercise. But do recognize that no matter what you do, she is going to suffer. That's just the way it is. You might lessen her financial difficulties, but you are not going to be able to protect her from suffering after your death. Also recognize that your wife is going to have a different grieving process than you. Her process will be unique to her and you have to respect her process as she has to respect yours. She might want to remain with you to the very end. I can't imagine too many people who wouldn't. It may be quite some time *after* your death before she is ready to have a new relationship, let alone *before* your death. It is admirable of you to think about her future and to want her to be happy. It really is. My advice is that instead of pushing her into a strange place relationship-wise, consult with a financial planner who deals with end of life issues. They may be able to help you deal with your house. Perhaps selling it and getting into a more sustainable arrangement now might make sense. Also, being to involve your trusted friends and family in your life. They will be your support network during the end of your life and they will be your wife's support network later. Also, if you have a terminal illness (or even if you don't) try to seek advice from someone who has faced or is facing a similar situation, like through a support group. Also, this book [How to Survive the Loss of a Love](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0931580439/) may be helpful to you. It's clear you love your wife very much. Coming from such a source of strength, I feel confident that you can work together to figure out how give you some degree of comfort about her future (but nothing will give you complete assurance) while allowing both of you to enjoy your remaining time together to the fullest. Consider that your final years together may be the greatest gift you can give to each other and your most lasting legacy to her, far more important than financial or practical considerations. A marriage and life together that comes to its end with grace, dignity, and love may be the very thing that is most important to allow her to someday move on to a future relationship.

The tools I buy at the store can build things. Cash just is used so that we don't have to resort to an old barter system. Rather than pay me in food and pelts and gems, you can just pay me in dollars. But, you don't even hand me a stack of bills any longer. You print out a check and I take that to the bank.

Some filters that I could suggest apart from grammar ( which might be iffy because it is sometimes subjective) and spelling would be length. Let's shoot for one page, no longer than three pages. This is long enough for an intro, body and conclusion without being too wordy. In addition, excessive use of CAPS and profanity riddled entries would be excluded as well.

When you flip through the pages of the flip book, you perceive movement. And if the man in the flip book could think- he would would perceive the pages of the flip book as time. On each page, he would believe that he existed in that particular moment. Now, as an external observer, we can flip to any page of the book we want, run it backwards or forwards, or just leave it be. *We* know that the man has no specific age, because from our point of view, his existence on each page is happening simultaneously. The moment of his birth and the moment of his death, and everything in between is happening simultaneously. Now imagine, if you will, that the moments of OUR lives exist in some sort of cosmic flip book. We are trapped in the flip book, so we think the order of events is fluidly moving forward. But what if we could step outside of our dimension and look down at ourselves? We would realize that just as a flip book is an object with a finite shape- so space-time is an object with finite shape. We would see also that we never really live and die, anymore than the man in our flip book lives and dies. His existence is eternal- he is forever existing simultaneously in every instant of his life. So it is for us. There is no eternal nothingness of time- because time itself is an illusion. Existence is a fixed shape of unknown dimensions. It is ever-present and experiences no change.

At the beginning of class, he'd put the answers up on the board, and give the whole class a few minutes to go through our own work, check it against what he put up, and figure out the score. Then he'd do a roll call, and each student would respond with their grade. At no point did he collect the work. Well, I have pretty bad ADD. I often forgot I had homework assigned, and it didn't take very long into the school year before I forgot my math homework. In my panic, I had a flash of inspiration: why not just pull out a blank sheet of paper, pretend to check through it, and call out a grade at the end? It's not like he'd know any different. I pulled this off for weeks. I never claimed perfect grades on my homework, but it was all A's. I did have the test grades to back that up.

cfamg0f,"Wow, something I'm actually qualified to answer to. My parents almost literally hated each other from the time my little sister was born (Circa 2000) all the way to the time they *finally* separated last year in the Summer. It was the biggest relief of my life. Now, everyone's situation is different (you don't seem to be fighting with your husband as much as my parents did toward the end, but they started off in your situation, just acting like they still loved each other), but coming from a family like that, there's a pretty good chance your kids know that mom and dad aren't really on the up-and-up. They're usually smart like that. I'd say, if you're really not happy in the relationship, the only thing to so is to go through with it in as calm and sincere a manner as possible, and make sure visitation is smooth, easy, and organized so that they can still keep a good relationship with both you and their father. Currently I'm a 2 hour plane ride from my dad and little sister, and it's been really weird for our relationship, but it's not been so bad since I see them often enough (we switch off holidays/breaks every year, and I visit them on long weekends when there's no holidays for a while). My mom, however, has been **way** happier since she moved away with myself and my older sister, and it really shows, and I feel much more comfortable as a person because of it. Even seeing some of my family less has let us all grow closer in small ways. I was depressed and anxious for years just because I had to be around my parents so often. Seeing them try and pass it off as if everything was fine was infuriating and horrifying, and I hated feeling like I had to walk on eggshells or something would bust and one of them would get unnecessarily angry from all the pent up feelings all over the place. I went from being about to flunk out of high school to actually working hard to get into college, because with the lack of stress, my future just didn't seem so bleak anymore. I guess the bottom line is that this isn't something you should leave alone for the sake of your kids.

Net neutrality ensures that an ISP can't throttle one website while allowing for another one to be used perfectly. Let's explain using an example, where there is no net neutrality: Netflix is a popular video streaming service. If an ISP has their own streaming service, they would want the customer to use that one instead (making more money), and could throttle Netflix making it effectively unusable. This leaves the user to choose between using the ISP's streaming service, or paying extra for ""being allowed"" to use Netflix. Substitute ""Netflix"" above with basically anything, and we'd have an internet that is controlled by what ISP's want us to see. A scary thought, isn't it?

But if you spend time in water, it's quite reasonable to expect you to learn to swim to spend that water-time safely, rather than being constantly in danger of death. It's like giving a kid a car without teaching them how to drive. If you don't ever put the kid behind the wheel of the car, fine. But if you do, you teach them how to do it safely. Certainly it's not a perfect comparison as not knowing how to swim is not likely to endanger others, but the comparison is in terms of the danger to self. It's not privileged to expect people to keep a kid safe. If you don't have time to go to places where you could swim, my comment doesn't apply. You're not in any danger if you're not in the water. But if you are letting kids spend time in the water without learning how to swim, you might as well encourage them to play in traffic.",0,0,1

A day without some form of contact, either physical contact or through other means, feels like a day that's empty. Going to bed without them beside you feels wrong. At first whenever you think about them it's lust and infatuation - there's excitement, there's desire, there's longing. They're a source of passion and intensity. Later on, after a while together, things become more secure. There may be less lust, but there's more calm respect. There may be less sexual intensity (or not, good for you) but there's more comfort. The passion is still there, but they become your other half, and it's more muted and based in long term goals then in the initial whirlwind stage. Their needs become just as important as your own, if not more so. Them being happy makes you happy, and you would willingly do things you don't enjoy as much as them just to see them smile.

And this is where I think a lot of young people have some things to learn. Boy I sure did. One of the most basic differences between people is how clean they like to keep things. Find out how your roommates feel about standards of cleanliness and come to an agreement about who is going to do what to keep things clean and organized. Another issue is sleep schedules and noise. Communicate about when you want to sleep and respect roommates' limits on when you can be loud. Another thing that will bite you later is security deposits. This is a deposit you put down when you move into a rental that covers any damage you might do if you walk away and can't be found again. If you would like any of this money back, you have to keep things in good shape. Don't put holes in the walls. Don't leave a lot of stains on stuff. Your landlord will try to keep all of it, but if you push back you should recover at least some of that deposit when you move.

c0q7crm,"Ok. Our numbers are 2, 17, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 109. So basically, you listed 10 points there. And you said ""what do these numbers have in common""? Well, it could be many things. You were probably going for them all being prime, but it could have been something else - maybe they were all primes less than 109. Maybe they were all just 2 or 3 digit numbers which don't involve 6, 5, or 8. Maybe what they all have in common is that they are all less than 110. It could be anything. There is no *real* way of knowing what the relationship among the numbers is, even though most of us could guess at what you were intending. So, since there's no way of knowing, any answer which is logical justified is really as good as any other. One way of coming up with a consistent answer is just polynomial interpolation. So, imagine that you have those points listed on the X, Y plane. You want a function which goes through all of those points - so when your x value is 1, the function's value is 2. When your x value is 2, the function's value is 17, and so on and so forth. In particular, we don't just want any function (because there are many functions with this property) - we want a polynomial (for no reason; just because). So, you can just put the numbers into a computer and it will spit out a polynomial which goes through all those points. And then what? Well, I have proven that each of those points is points on a particular polynomial (and believe me, there are *many* polynomials, functions, and relations with this property) - so perhaps that is what they have in common? If so, then the next number could just be found by putting in x = 11. An entirely logically valid solution, even if it's not what is intended.

Far too many people treat their vehicle like a washing machine, meaning they just push a couple of buttons, and the car does the rest. When you hit the road, you are mixing it up with hundreds or even thousands of other people who all have different destinations. Make an effort to anticipate what other drivers are doing, and help others know what you are going to do by *being predictable*. Use your turn signals. Plan your moves ahead of time- if you know that you will be making a turn as part of your route, get into the appropriate lane well in advance so you don't have to do a last-minute lane change that will cause someone else to have to avoid you. Accommodate other drivers if you can. Don't be aggressive- two-ton vehicles are not appropriate tools for conflict resolution. Give yourself ample time to get where you are going, if you can. Not being in a rush will make you more relaxed and less likely to make mistakes that can cause yourself and others inconvenience at best, or death at worst. All of these things simply require that you put some thought into what you and other drivers are doing, and treat driving as a social contract rather than a gladiatorial event where the goal is to come out on top.",0,0,1

degx3id,"And for that matter, what do we pick on Kim Jong Un? After all he was elected to the Supreme People's Assembly with 100% of the vote... To be fair, AFAIK there is a very large segment of Crimea who want to become part of Russia, for better or for worse. It might have even been enough for them to exit via a referendum. However the events surrounding the referendum (you know, with Russian troops everywhere) and the fact that it seems to have passed nearly unanimously makes me suspicious of the whole thing. Also, living in a country (Canada) which is still going through it's own (much less violent, much less scary) ""let's vote to leave the country"" it is never quite as simple as leaving the country. For one there is infrastructure in Crimea that is more or less owned by the government. The fledgling government would probably have to find some way to handle that. There's also questions of nationality and who has what rights at the border. There's questions about currency (although less so in this case). And there's the really interesting question - if Crimea can split off from Ukraine, why can certain regions not split from Crimea and rejoin Ukraine. This is especially notable in the case of the Crimean Tatars, who have have long suffered discrimination under Russian rule (and have been told to expect more of the same once Russia takes over, from what I understand).",0,0,1

It was light enough to see. I think I heard light, even breathing. I asked ""who is there?"". I was pretty scared. This lasted maybe 10 seconds. Then, the bed seemed to act like whatever was sitting on it got up. It raised a bit by my feet, returning to a flat, normal orientation. I heard the swish of fabric again (like maybe muslin on muslin, sackcloth or something rough on something rough), and heard a faint giggle, like a little girl or young boy. It seemed to come from behind my head. It seemed faraway to me. Then, nothing. I was actually very frightened. To this day, I cannot explain the sensations I felt that night.

cflq9bl,"The Wikipedia page goes into a fair amount of detail, but it covers the same points as the description I received from my therapist. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing My therapy used the side-to-side eye movement type of bilateral sensory input. This input may be similar in nature to how binaural beats are formed. The result was that at first I thought it was bogus - it was like hypnosis in cartoons in a way. I felt nothing as we went through the procedure, following my therapists hand back and forth as I tried to do as instructed and think about specific traumatic events as we discussed. By the end of the session, after several of these eye movement exercises, with only brief and carefully placed discussion between, I began to feel hazy and dissociative, as I would have from talking through the issues like we normally do. Still I thought it was hokey. I went home and didn't see my therapist for a few days. Nothing seemed to have happened - I felt about the same as before that session. Until I went to sleep. My dreams were severely disturbing - much more so than usual. The subjects and themes and people in them were intense and all had to do with the traumas. After a few nights of this, the intensity of the dreams subsided. Just in time for my next session. After a few sessions I couldn't ignore the pattern - and the intense dreams; the dissociation was all normal and to be expected, I was told. It was a result of my brain processing the traumatic memories - memories that had been locked in an unprocessable loop until we worked on them with the EMDR. After about ten sessions I noticed a peculiar thing. I found myself presented with triggering situations, as often was the case, but I no longer had as strong a reaction. The emotional punch had been taken out of some thoughts, and all that remained was the facts. I was able to think about certain traumatic events, some that had previously sent me into a rageful despair, but without feeling much of anything. I recognized the significance of this when I found I was able to consider these formerly corrosively emotional thoughts as I would any other, and put them into a greater picture like pieces of a puzzle. The memories no longer had control over me, and I was able to begin putting them to rest. We had several chunks of sessions like this, separated by several weeks as I took time to process more. The EMDR was like a catalyst for finally being able to put distressing thoughts to rest.",0,0,1

diyy5lf,"This is so true. I went to a high school out of my district because it was the closest one that offered the French Immersion program that I was in. This school happened to have a majority of kids who were mostly higher on the socioeconomic scale and didn't know what it was like to stress about money as an individual or as a family. However, growing up that way has shaped me in what I believe to be a positive way. It's made me appreciate what I do have, to place more value on relationships, people and the time spent with them versus accumulating things. So whether we're taking a vacation or hanging out at someone's house, it's the time I value, not any money I might have spent to be there. Plus, as a carry over from my upbringing, I'm really frugal and tend to be the kind of person who's content as long as the bills are paid and I'd prefer to put most of what's leftover directly into savings so I'm never in a ""no money"" position again (and at times I take that to an extreme - I'm still learning). Interestingly enough, my husband grew up in a family that was upper middle class and could pretty much afford to do whatever he wanted. I've definitely noticed a pretty big difference in how we feel about spending money, and his approach towards money in general due to his upbringing. He actually got himself into a bit of a bind financially after he moved out on his own and bought a house even despite the fact that he had a great starting salary at his job out of college. He just kept spending the way he had and the way he'd watched his parents do his entire life and didn't adjust for the fact that his income, while great for his age, wasn't anywhere near what he grew up with. He's still learning to spend less and place less value on material items, while I'm still learning that we don't need to hoard every penny in our savings accounts and can afford to treat ourselves occasionally. We're basically teaching and learning from each other. This was way longer than I intended. Oops.",0,0,1

djfioor,"Cattle can have an extremely beneficial impact on the grass, that's for sure! Management needs to be on point to allow that happen. Crowding (herding) is actually an effective tool to build soil by grazing and trampling the rest onto the soil, which then feeds soil microbes. I haven't practiced super high densities but my mentors have and it's pretty crazy. But good. Grazing does take a different mentality, and it is an extreme struggle for many farmers, as many farmers have a mentality that they are responsible for everything and want it all controlled. CAFOs allow for controlled conditions and variables, I'll give them that (but they aren't a viable solution imo). This is why a lot of farmers don't opt out and go to grazing even though it is more profitable. Many confinement farmers would be and are scared to death of cattle getting out, baking in the sun, mudding up the pasture, etc. Those are potential problems, but overblown for the most part. In many ways, I think that the confinement paradigm allows space for the thought that we can ""solve"" every problem by inputting something like a new chemical wormer or discovering the perfect blend of feed, and is unaffected by drought or flooding. To be successful at grazing you have to understand that nature throws 12 to 6 curveballs and not everything can be avoided.",0,0,1

It says nothing based on what we've learned through more extensive research, or space travel. Flat Earth theory demands that NASA be actively deceiving. That suspends credulity for many people. It's the same basic argument that the sun and moon appearing the same size in the sky can be easily explained by the scientific model that the moon is 400 times smaller but coincidentally 400 times closer than the sun. It can also be explained by the sun and moon simply *being* the same size and distance from the Earth. Other tests and methods of observation can disprove that.

cfff2m6,"Essentially, the fairtax replaces the current income &amp; payroll taxes (15.3% split evenly between employer &amp; employee) with a national sales tax. No federal taxes would be withheld from your paycheck, so your paycheck automatically increases by 22.15% (assuming 14.5% federal tax rate). The tax rate is a bit high at 30% (23% inclusive).. aka if you bought a $100 item, it would already include the sales tax. The item would be $77 + $23 tax. It isn't quite as bad as it looks due to the increased paychecks &amp; the fact that all spending up to the poverty line is effectively tax free due to the prebate. In order to make the plan a bit more progressive, there is a prebate system that every lawful US citizen would be entitled to. This prebate provides a monthly payment that eliminates the tax burden on all money spent up to the poverty level. Like every tax system, there are many pros &amp; cons.. Here are some: Pros: -everybody in the US (regardless of if they're a citizen, undocumented, tourist, etc) pays taxes. -Used items are tax free -You as an individual can effectively choose how much you want to pay in taxes. Cons: -Incentivizing saving could slow down the economy -It isn't as progressive as our current tax system -Eliminates social engineering tax deductions like mortgage/charity/college write-offs. I greatly encourage you to do some research for yourself as I know that even though I tried to be as objective as possible, my post shouldn't be entirely trusted due to my biases in favor of the system.

Many people can vent their frustrations and de-stress by talking about their problems, but of those some feel a need to cause strife in others to feel better about their problems.

dfdk1av,"0dB is not the maximum the rest of this is copied from another comment You are comparing apples and Oranges. dB isn't actually a unit in itself it is a scale. 0dB in digital is not the same as in analog. in Analog audio 0dB usually means unity gain. it means no attenuation and no gain. That is what it means on a Fader. On the other hand there are VU meters where 0dBVU is a Volt (I think). there is also acoustic measurements measured in dBSPL where 0dBSPL is 20 pascals of pressure. dB is a gain measurement so it is output/input so whatever unit you are using cancels out. The actual equation is 10Log(out/in) and if it is voltage you are measuring it is 20Log(Vout/Vin), the difference has to do with ohm's law, power dissipation in a load, and the properties of Logarithms. Log is log based 10 by the way. dB is a logarithmic scale that is used because it make math easier and you can graph it in a more easily read display. in digital you are using what is called dBFS where FS stands for Full Scale and 0dB is defined by the maximum amplitude you sample. So you can't go above 0dB because that is defined as the maximum. When you push a fader on an analog board above 0dB it is not just saturating it all that means is it is adding gain and the output is larger than the input. That is all it means. If you clip the analog signal you are hitting the limits of the analog circuit which can sound pleasing, and most people enjoy analog distortion that adds even order harmonics. In amplifiers this usually means you're output voltage level is hitting the voltage rails of the amplifier, basically it comes from the fact that you can't get more power than what you are supplying so if your signal hits the voltage you are supplying to your amplifier it can't go any further. But that level in dB depends on the input and the specific amplifier. There are other dB scales like dBm where 0dBm = 1mW, or dBu where 0dB = 4 Volts. etc. Anyways point being you cannot compare dB on tape and dB in digital.",0,0,1

While we don't have sex as much as we used to, we still have it frequently. Usually at least 1 or 2 times per week. We also both saved ourselves for each other until marriage, so, believe it or not, that has a lot to do with it. There's something subconsciously appealing about that. There's nothing we compare ourselves to at the back of our minds as a result. Of course, as you age, looks fade, but you can slow down that process by staying healthy via a healthy diet and an active lifestyle. Regardless, despite the slow decline in aesthetics, all of that is easily compensated by the emotional and more innate attachment that you develop for your SO. When I look at my wife, I can almost see no difference between her and the woman I fell in love with and married 21 years ago. I have seen her almost every day of my life for the past 21 years, so I didn't have time to notice the changes. They happen gradually and you acclimatize to them gradually. tl;dr: we both stayed in shape, but not only that, the emotional side of things from such a long commitment compensates for the decline in looks. My wife is my best friend.",0,0,1

dic3oqe,"There was a McDonald's commercial from about 10-15 years ago that I still remember. It started by cutting back and forth from a guy on the phone with his friend and a girl on the phone with her friend talking about the date they're about to go on with one another and whether or not either thinks they'll kiss. The guy drives the girl through the McDonald's drive through and after he places their order she goes ""and no onions"", he repeats this to the intercom with this wide smile on his face. I saw this when I was in high school and loved everything about it. First, it is clearly targeting high-school age kids which is brilliant in and of itself because McDonald's is a cheap place for kids with no income to go on a date. But on top of that the writer knew exactly what high-school age kids cared about and how they felt. Most commercials targeting that demographic are written by older people who have no idea what kids that age are like. The simplicity of it was amazing too, two nervous kids on a date hoping they'll kiss and all she says is ""no onions"" and nothing could make make this guy happier. And it all happened...at a McDonald's, where dreams come true. I still remember that commercial to this day as one of the most genius despite being so simple.",0,0,1

cf23hg6,"This is known as the Mpemba Effect and doesn't always occur, but it does occur regularly when the experiment is repeated. Each water molecule is composed of one oxygen atom bonded covalently to two hydrogen molecules. These bonds involve atoms sharing electrons and are well understood. The separate water molecules are also bound together by weaker forces generated by hydrogen bonds. These forces occur when a hydrogen atom from one molecule of water sits close to an oxygen atom from another. It is these bonds that cause the Mpemba effect. When the water molecules are brought into close contact, a natural repulsion between the molecules causes the covalent bonds to stretch and store energy. When the liquid warms up, the hydrogen bonds stretch as the water gets less dense and the molecules move further apart. The following is also not a conclusively proven hypothesis, but is the primary theory behind this effect at present. The stretching in the hydrogen bonds allows the covalent bonds to relax and shrink somewhat, which causes them to give up their energy. The process of covalent bonds giving up their energy is essentially the same as cooling, and so warm water should in theory cool faster than cold. The teamâ€™s calculations suggest that the magnitude of the covalent bond relaxation accounts for the experimental differences in the time it takes for hot and cold water to freeze.

The game creator Masahiro Sakurai stated when he made Kirby it was easy enough to play and hard enough to beat(or something to that effect I don't remember where I read that). I found this to be very true because, I remember one day I was playing Kirby on my Game Boy Advance when my aunt who does not play games was looking over my shoulder and was intrigued. She asked to borrow the game and she played it for weeks. I wanted to ask for it back but she was having so much fun with it, and I asked her why was she so drawn to this game.

diy8pcf,"The first thing that really got my partner and I thinking was the money issue. We were living at just above the poverty line at the time. To us, that wasn't the kind of life we wanted to give a child. As we put thought into it, other reasons popped up. We both suffer from mental illness, him from depression, me from anxiety. Not only do we risk passing that on, but maintaining our mental health takes time and effort. We need alone time, our hobbies, and social connections to keep us balanced. Raising a child means losing a lot of those things, especially the alone time. Essentially, having a child would make us less capable parents. Since my husband and I spent much of our 20s struggling financially, now that we are stable in our early 30s we want to enjoy our life. We're not ready to give it up. Which is what raising a child demands. Besides all that, I am scared of pregnancy. I wouldn't say that I'm full on tokophobic, but it really is something that weirds me out and I have no desire to ever have something growing in me like that. I find it squicky. And last but not least, I just don't want a child that badly. I really feel that of you are going to have kids you need to want it totally and completely. A child is a new life, a new human being. That's huge. If you don't want a child absolutely and completely and aren't prepared to love them no matter what, no matter who they turn out to be, then you don't want a child enough to have one. If one reason gives you more then a moment's pause or has more weight than a logistical concern, you're not ready to be a parent. IMHO.",0,0,1
df7u0tq,"Back in college during the summer, within a span of 3 days: I was driving home from the mall in a thunderstorm. I'm at a light with a utility pole right by my car. Loud bang, everything turns bright white. When I can see again that pole was missing and there was a nice spark shower headed for my car. The next day, I go out to get a phone line splitter so I can use DSL. Earlier that morning, my collision insurance for my car expired. Well, it just so happened that my brakes died on the highway, and the car in front of me stopped, and I couldn't change lanes due to other cars. The day after that, my professor who I had been working for over the summer lent me his bike. I'm riding back, and happen to be in one of the only areas in the entire town with a hill and trees, and a few people on motorcycles come and run me off the road (which landed me into the tree). Anyway, later on that summer, I had gone to some relatives to stay for a week or so, and I woke up a little late and had to rush to the airport to catch the plane.

My advice is you have to know when to ask for help. The people at the company who know you're an Intern and aren't expecting you to have a lot of real world experience. In other words, they expect that you aren't going to know everything, so ask them questions. This is something I still am trying to grasp, as often I will feel useless when I don't understand something, but you need to ask people for help. Also, show other people you are willing to learn. That might take different forms, such as asking questions to better understand your project, asking sooeone show you how to do something, or taking classes if your company offers them. Also, if you feel you need to, you can also ask your supervisor if you can stay later, so you can have extra time to complete projects. tl;dr: If people know you're an Intern, they don't expect you to know everything.

The channels are received, groomed, and transported digitally through the back office until it hits the plant. From there it goes out into the field via a QAM (what converts digital signal to RF). I won't go into switched digital television, and how it saves bandwidth. Each QAM can handle ~38.8 mbs of video, so ~3 HD channels, or ~10 SD channels. Additionally, each QAM operates at a certain frequency using up a certain part of the spectrum. Internet usually comes from DOCSIS modems (either 2.0 or 3.0 if you're area has been upgraded). DOCSIS uses a totally different part of the spectrum. So no, watching TV is not the same as using bandwidth.",0,0,1

c3f0uhj,"What you're talking about is roughly analogous to the 19th century theory that all mythology was essentially aetiological -- i.e. that myths were how primitive cultures explained the natural world. That theory went through a period of vogue with the classical anthropologists, but was kept aloft mostly by ignoring any examples that didn't tend to confirm the theory. During the 20th century, anthropology largely abandoned the aetiological thesis. A better explanation for the appearance of nature motifs in religions is simply that cultures tend to co-opt their religious symbols from the things that they depend upon. Hunter-gatherer societies tend to have religious forms that feature hunting-related symbols, like the totems of Native American religion and the deer-headed gods of ancient pagan observance, or gathering grounds like the forest, as with the druids. Agricultural societies tend to have religious forms that feature natural emblems related to agriculture, e.g. sun gods, rain gods, fertility gods, and so on. There's a two part answer for the progressive whittling down of pantheons that we seem to observe in recent history. The first part is simply that we in the West are most often exposed to the religions of the Abrahamic tradition -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The latter two inherit the injunction to uphold strict monotheism from Judaism. So what you're seeing is mostly a single branch of modern religious observance. If you were looking at religion from a perspective closer to Buddhism, Shinto, Hinduism or any number of extant folk religions, you'd probably come away with a much different perception. The second part of the answer pertains specifically to the Abrahamic traditions with which most of us are directly familiar. As I said above, the religious forms native to any given religion will tend to have been drawn from the daily experience of those within that culture. Jewish and Christian religion contain a great many agricultural symbols (""the good shepherd,"" for example), but the Abrahamic religions are, properly speaking, not agricultural religions. They are, rather, urban or urban-agricultural, and they draw much of their symbolic content from social forms with which most of us are so familiar that they don't often strike us as being as obviously symbolic as the symbols we see from, say, ancient Egyptian religion. Bear in mind that Christianity originally arose in the context of Roman urbanism, and while ancient Judaism may have grown up in the transition from nomadism to agricultural settlement, the largely rabbinic Judaism that we know today emerged from Judean, Babylonian, Alexandrian and Roman contexts. That's not a whittling down in response to scientific advance, but rather an organic process of situating religious ideas in a context that will be familiar to those participating in the religion. Recently, there's been a resurgence (particularly among the so-called New Atheists) of the aetiological interpretation of religion, but there's little evidence to support that religion was originally a means of explaining the natural world. Rather, religion appears to have incorporated whatever was known at the time, into a tapestry of meaning.",0,0,1

Pick a skill you'd like to have and resolve to try it and make a consistent effort even if you don't seem improvement right away. If you still hate it, pick a new skill and try again) Because I'm single and bored, I have a whole bunch of new hobbies and skills. - friends who are spontaneous. If you don't have friends, find one person who you can tolerate and invite them to something related to a hobby you both might be interested in. - pets or gardens, or both. - get outdoors. Leave your phone behind and go for a walk/jog/bike - Volunteer. - Read. Find a reading list that will push you to read things outside of your comfort zone. This will help you in many ways: You will have more to contribute to conversation, broaden your understanding of the world, improve your vocabulary, increase your attention span, etc. - Take an online course with deadlines. I like to study at starbucks when I'm feeling really lonely. I enjoy the ambiance and when I'm studying, I have a reason to just sit there. While learning. Deadlines keep me from procrastinating too much. - Live by the motto: ""Leave it better."" Focus on what you can do for others. - be ok with being lonely and understand that others are lonely too. People who are single and people who are coupled up. We're all in this together. I've never been in a relationship, and I have moments where I'm ok and moments when I'm really lonely.

cgefz3a,"I've always had an unusual relationship with money. I was heartbroken after twice walking away from Web design firms I helped to launch in the 90s. Fortunately, that second departure coincided with an inheritance, and it also involved a legitimate severance package, so I had 2-3 years of living large with no obligations. During this period there were two types of days for me. The routine involved getting out of the house at midday, grabbing lunch, catching a movie or visiting an arcade, then either gaming with friends or hanging out in bars until late in the evening. Alternatively, I might just stay home and spend the entire day with video games and movies. Weed was pervasive at this time in my life. More recently, I have had serious health problems. Next week I'll finally know if my renal cancer has been treated successfully or if I'll be losing a kidney sometime soon. Also, I'm on the books for a defibrillator implant at the end of the month, because I have a severe case of congestive heart failure. Initially, I applied for disability benefit just to get around the absurd barriers to Medicaid access in my state. That said, a few hundred dollars per month makes a world of difference to a guy with no other income. Lately, I sleep a lot more, and medical matters take up quite a bit of my time, but still I fall back on video games and television to keep my spirits up. My condition is aggravated by stress and it leaves me winded after only a little bit of physical exertion, so now I take it easy as a matter of survival rather than personal preference.

The moon's gravitational pull, at this distance, isn't particularly impressive. it is enough to have a slight effect, a slight pulling effect, but it is nowhere near powerful enough to actually 'pick up' anything on Earth. but it will kind of tug lightly on it. When that effect is on bodies of water, you will see some effects, a slight tugging, performed an incalculable number of times on each molecule of water, that will result in a slight swelling, which in turn effects the tides. But the effect on humans is essentially negligible. Perhaps you weigh a thousandth of a gram less than you would if it were on the other side of the world. The relationship between the moon and Earth is essentially that of two bodies which are being pulled apart, but haven't managed to escape each other yet. Basically, you're trying to visualize gravity, and you're doing it wrong.",0,0,1

Every memory you have now will fade away with time, willing or not, you can't memorize everything for an infinite amount of time (assuming in a possible after death life our memory would still work in the same way). This means the being you are now will cease to exist soon or later, you wouldn't have any memory at all of who you are now. And that's essentially the same thing that would happen with the ""no life after death"" option: no memory at all of the life you've lived. With the only difference that in one case the step will be ""instantaneous"", in the other one your memories will slowly be replaced by others and fade away leaving you with a nostalgic feeling. Forever. And for an infinite amount of times. Personally I prefer much more the first option. It's not that great, but that's the best between these complementary choices.",0,0,1

To this end, I make sure alcohol is always on hand, but nobody overindulges. Anyway, this is a coping strategy because my main problem from my perspective is that I don't get enough attention.

I went to work at 7, came home at 5-530ish, ate a lite snack and immediately went to the gym. I exercised for 1.5hrs then would go get dinner at Subway (its a quick, cheap, and if you get just bread, meat and veggies as you suggested its low in calories). Then go somewhere other than home! I found the problem I had was in the downtime. I would eat for no reason, just because I was bored. Find something to do. I went to Barnes and Noble and read, or went to a movie, or anything but sit at home. I ate fruit and yogurt for breakfast, veggies for lunch, and Subway for dinner. It worked great and I went on to lose 30 more lbs after the summer before it was all over. One concern though, make sure you do get enough nutrition. One of the reasons I lost so much weight so quickly is because I was half starving myself, only eating about 1000 calories/dy. I stopped sleeping through the night and found myself in a haze all the time. I saw a doc and he told me to eat a cheeseburger and bring my calories/dy up. That was the best cheeseburger in my life, and the 12hrs of sleep after felt awesome. If you want to lose weight and are afraid of losing your willpower completely change up your routine and get into good habits.

I had an Aspiration Procedure which I suggest you get if you are still early in the pregnancy. Its not surgical, takes only about 5 min and doesn't require any return visits. There are a couple minutes it feels like really bad period cramps but is painless once its over. It begins your period and you are good to go. I paid $400 for mine and felt great about it. I was surprised at how quick and easy it was for me and I felt good after know I live in an age where I can control my body. I think the best advice to give is catch it early and get treated early. The earlier term abortions are quick and easier. Also, I was advised against the pill option because its much less effective, more painful, and you have to go into the doctors for follow ups where as the Aspiration Procedure is one short visit and then you are free to live the rest of your life the way you want :D Let medical science empower and don't feel guilty, I know I didn't.",0,0,1

djtgq3g,"BS Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) from the University of Cincinnati. I chose Engineering over Psychology because of the ""job security"". My education involved taking various courses in the various realms of CEE. It also involved co-op jobs with a defense contractor, engineering consulting company, and a local municipality. About halfway through my education, I realized my heart wasn't in it to become an Engineer. I was burnt out. I dropped out for half a year. Slowly began looking at transferring my major to Communications. Unfortunately, nearly all my credits wouldn't transfer over. I decided the best thing to do was to finish my engineering education, graduate, get my first job, and go from there. The last years of college I slogged away. At the end of my freshman year, I had a 4.0 GPA. 5 years later, at graduation, it was 3.0, which was okay. Since then I have worked at the following careers: Environmental Engineering at a division of a Fortune 500 company IT Consulting: Application Development, Strategy and Testing Hospitality: Bartending and Food Service Volunteer Founder and Community Manager, Media Producer for a media and marketing meetup group CRM/Tech Support for Software Company Adjunct Instructor of Business, Marketing and Personal Development Custom and Corporate Apparel and Promotional Product Sales Marketing, Media, and Strategy at a Private Healthcare Practice It took me about 20 years to finally get to a marketing and communications role. Because of my career and job changes from Engineering and IT, I have taken pay cuts to work at jobs to gain the training and experience needed to be in this field. It wasn't until I was 39 years old that I finally realized what my vocation in life was and connected with it. My engineering training still guides how I approach my work, and I often find myself bringing up things from it as I go about my life: driving in traffic, any time I see a bridge, climate change and air quality discussions, etc. ""Not all who wander are lost."" - J.R.R. Tolkien UPDATE: Thanks for the upvotes. One thing to think about with regard to college education: A lot of the jobs I've worked at are ones that did not exist when I was in school. Some perspective: Windows had just come out. Email was only done, if at all, on a desktop computer. Even then, it was still very cumbersome. Digital voicemail on your landline phone was the new thing that could replace your answering machine. Web browsing would start to be more popular after I graduated. Educators are training students who will work at jobs and have careers that involve technology that hasn't been invented yet. Perhaps, then, the purpose of getting an education is not just the degree, but the skills and experience learned so you can further apply and learn after graduation.",0,0,1

One guy just liked watching me play videogames and we had a beer or two, we would chat about our day and then he was back at his room. If the door was closed people would not bother you.

You could tell by the way they were dressed that they were very poor. I am guessing they may have been transient. Mom was quiet. Looked miserable. Almost like she was angry but afraid to speak. The father was too friendly. Kept telling me how awesome I was, and how amazing the restaurant was. The daughter looked like she was slow. A lot of baby talking. Referred to the parents as Daddy and Mommy. Here is where it gets really weird. The father kept his arm around the ittle girls shoulder the whole time wrapped tight. He pet her a lot and was way over the top with the affection. Kept calling her pet names... darling, sweety, honey, etc. He baby talked her a lot. He told her that he loved her a bunch of times. They ended up leaving without ordering anything. They were in the restaurant for about 15 minutes. It was like Dad wanted to come in for a chat. I was a little busy as they were leaving because I had a group of employees from another restaurant coming in post-shift. I didn't really get a chance to digest what I saw. When I got home that night I really started to think about how fucking weird that whole exchange was. If I had to guess, that couple kidnapped that little girl when she was younger and were transient to avoid being caught. I dread to think that she might have been some kind of sex slave to that creepy old fucker but in hindsight my gut tells me thats what it was. When I got to work the next day my manager asked WTF was up with ""the hillbillies"" that came in the night before. We started talking and his gut was telling him the same thing mine was. I ended calling one of my regulars who was a cop. He said that from our description it sounds like we were right and they were some kind of transients trying to avoid the law and that the girl was most likely an abduction.

In practice, prostitution is relatively-wealthy men getting away with dangling their control over necessities like food and shelter to get away with raping poor women. It's middle class men and rich men hunting poor women who can't afford to say no, because they're sick enough that a woman (or man) who can't afford to say no is sexy to them. If you tell me that you have sex with prostitutes, you better have a really good medical reason for it, and you better treat them as well (and pay them as well) as you would your therapist.

He was a recent immigrant from the former Yugoslavia (This was late 90's early 2000's, his family left due to the civil war), he could barely speak English and was poor as hell, his family shared a tiny apartment with two other families. Anyway, he was real weird. Even the nerdy kids like me thought so. He was really really into WWF and Hulk Hogan in general. He had all of this old wrestling shit from goodwill, including all these 80s VHS tapes, the infamous Wrestling Boot Band album on cassette, and a bunch of old Hulk Hogan figures with the paint almost all worn off. Also, he would tell everyone that his uncle was Hulk Hogan. He would write up these ridiculous Chris-Chan-esque video game proposals, starring himself, and send them to companies like EA, asking for them to mail him a copy of the game when they were finished making it. Also, when the PS2 came out, he told everyone that he had a prototype PS3 (That his uncle gave him lol), that could play all games from every console. AFAIK the only game system he actually owned was a hand-me-down NES with two or three games. He was horny as hell, and would fap to pretty much anything. He would take the city bus to get places, because his family could not afford a car, and would collect transfers from the bus drivers and draw boobs and vaginas on them. He kept a collection of them in his desk. The best was when we read Anne Frank, he would silently fap to the picture of Anne Frank on the cover. He never had a computer at home, so he would also download porn on the school computers whenever he had the chance, and was eventually banned from them. Anyway, I have absolutely no idea what became of him, I left the school district before graduation.",0,1,0

My manager is an older latino woman that used to terrify me before I realized that she's pretty cool. This was my second day at work. A customer comes up, orders a sandwich (for this scenario, how about we go with a BMT?), and on this particular day, Miss Maria was working the meats. So, as she's slapping some salami on that soft piece of bread, I--being the overeager, day-two employee I was--ask the customer, ""What kind of cheese you want, sir?"" ""White American,"" he mumbles into his neck. And without missing a beat, I'm all, ""Good choice, sir. I like my Americans white too."" The next instant, I realize what I'd just said. When my *latino* manager stopped, mid-sandwich, and turned to stare at me, like, utterly *flabbergasted*. I stood there for a few minutes, trying to stutter an explanation, but I was totally sure I was just digging this career's grave. Especially since saying, ""I didn't mean to, uh, be racist... like, I meant...um, sexually"" (which was actually the truth). Honestly, I probably would've lost my job that minute if I hadn't been so nervous that I'd only whispered the former comment. From what I can remember, she'd only turned to look when I'd start stuttering and thought she'd hired a ""special"" worker. A week later, I couldn't get her to believe I have all 'A's.

dgryian,"You can't divorce what a modern homosexual relationship looks like from the context it grew out of. We currently have homosexuality outlawed/persecuted in numerous countries, with the [Chechnyean concentration camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_concentration_camps_in_Chechnya) being the most recent news blip. In the U.S. it was a capital offense for most of history with progress starting to be made in the mid-60's. I think it's fair to say that being gay has been a hard thing for most of history. So consider a population a few decades back, 90% are straight, 10% gay, and all of them have some variance in sex drive (1-10). We're not barbaric, so we don't burn, institutionalize, or chemically castrate homosexuals like Turing anymore. Instead you just face social ostracization/""disapproval"" which can translate into things like inability to find work or the asymmetric [homelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness_among_LGBT_youth_in_the_United_States) we currently see with LGBT youths. Since there is a pressure not to be homosexual, those that have a low sex drive may be able to live a life of abstinence or faked heterosexuality (e.g., anyone from 1-3). This leaves you with an actively homosexual population that has effectively filtered out anyone with a lower sex drive, which is on average more promiscuis than the heterosexual population that didn't have that pressure. And what sort of relationships should you expect to see? Ones where both parties seek to remain anonymous so they don't get out'ed? Secretive ones where it's hard to maintain a healthy lasting monogamous relationship? Ones that lack any sort of education on safe practices or ways to seek medical advice/treatment, that are more susceptible to things like the spread of AIDs? As for the second point, you believe a loving God made AIDs and made it more transmissible through tearing that occurs in anal sex. So God loves lesbians who have lower risk than heterosexual couples? God is fine with casual oral sex? God hates straight couples that have anal sex? God is okay with monogamous homosexuality (plenty of gay couples that are)? God made homosexuality not too uncommon in the natural world, but it isn't cool with humans? God also made things like nodding disease, or other pathogens and parasites that explicitly target (poor) children/infants?

A 2.5 will graduate you, a 3.5 would help for an interview. * Work while in school. No one cares you graduated since there's hundreds of thousands of us every year. Have some experience to peddle for a job after college. * Join a club. It'll help keep you sane. * If you're not determined to enter STEM heavy fields, pick your major based on what you're good at and interested in. You can still land a good job with an Art History or English or Philosophy degree if you do things outside of school and have decent grades. Disregard this if you're trying to get into Degree-orientated fields like Engineering or Sciences. * Don't bring too much shit to your dorm when you move in. You won't need 90% of what they tell you you should bring. Try to coordinate major furnishings with your dorm mate once you find out who they are. * Keep your place clean. It's easier to just make a habit of keeping shit clean than have it pile up and seem like a crazy amount of work to make it look nice. Plus, it gives a better impression to the other sex when they find that your place is clean. * Make some firm ground rules with people you move in with and make sure it sticks.

cermkaa,"So, I'm fat. Let's not get into an argument about why and just accept the premise that I am. I'm also diabetic. This means I have to take medications that make my blood sugar trend downward. This is generally not a problem, but from time to time it means I have to eat something sugary or starchy to ensure my blood sugar doesn't become dangerously low. On more than one occasion, I have had incidents where I had eaten almost nothing all day, and late in the day I could feel my blood sugar becoming low enough that it would become dangerous soon if it wasn't already, and I nabbed a small packet of chips to eat so I could have high enough blood sugar safely get myself home to a healthier meal instead of passing out and having to go to the hospital. And hon, let me tell you, nothing attracts dirty looks and vile remarks faster than a fat man eating a tiny packet of chips on the subway. People take it as license to tell me how fat and ugly and disgusting I am and that it's all my fault for eating like that and how dare I. Bluntly, when a person has low blood sugar they get quite cranky, and those people should count themselves lucky that I didn't beat the living crap out of them before stopping to think about it. But no, they felt entitled to lecture me about what a disgusting overeating pig I am, when I'm eating a tiny packet of chips *because* I had eaten practically (or actually) nothing all day. Yeah, it's bad when a parent doesn't give their child decent nutrition. However, when you see a parent giving their child mcdonalds food, *it's not your place to judge them.* Maybe the kid is fat because they eat crap at mcdonalds all the time, or maybe the kid is fat for other reasons and the family is having a difficult day and just stopped at mcdonalds because it was there and fast and they didn't have the time and energy to find something better... just that once.

dcgc656,"My mom is a 5th grade teacher. She's been teaching for 30 years. There was one kid who stood out far beyond any other. The kid was a real sociopath. He would bring knives to school. Randomly beat up other kids. He bragged to my mom that he had to move to her school because he beat the shit out of his 5 year old neighbor with a 2 x 4 plank and put her in the hospital. Never showed any remorse, just couldn't understand why people were upset with violence. The worst part was that both of his parents were teachers. He is Mom was a second grade teacher in my mom's school and his dad was a special ed teacher at the high school. His dad had got him labeled as a special ed student, so normal disciplinary actions could not be taken against him, as he was not legally liable for his behavior. Obviously, his parents knew of issues and set it up to protect themselves from this kid's actions. Now to the melt down: one day, for no apparent reason, this kid just stands up and decks the kid next to him, knocking him out of the desk. He starts yelling and cursing that he's going to kill everyone in the class room. He then turns around and decks the girl sitting behind him, giving her a bloody nose. My mom starts yelling at him, trying to get control of the situation. He picks up his desk and throws it at my mom, hitting her in the chest and nocking her to the floor. He continues to go about punching other kids in the face. My mom then gets up and orders all of the other students out of the room and to go into the class room next door. Luckily, this kid doesn't follow. He just keeps yelling and throwing desks at my mom. She leaves and corrals the kids in the other classroom and has the other teacher call the principal and security. Before they get there, the kid runs out of the class room and outside to the play ground. My mom follows him until they reach the fence and kid climbs it and runs off. My mom was about 55 at the time and couldn't follow. The cops had to sweep the neighborhood to eventually find him. In the end, the kid got no punishment because of his special ed exemption. And, his crazy ass parents tried to blame my mom for not ""correctly handling the situation"" and attempted to sue her. Luckily, nothing came of the law suit. But to this day, he was by far the worst student she ever had. To quote her: ""he is the only person I've ever met who was truely evil, down to the core. He had zero remorse for committing violence against others. He had no inkling of empathy for others.

Plenty of presidents have been assassinated, Reagen was shot and almost assassinated himself. They were lone gunmen. None of them had the conspiratorial fervor of JFK's conspiracy. And the fact you still cling on to this obvious fallacious conclusion reinforces that you are either an intellectually shallow person or you are a disingenuous person who is misrepresenting how much you ""looked into"" this conspiracy.

You only see the best of the best that they want you to believe is their entire life.(I'm still guilty of this but I know its my fault). Find what you love to do in life and try to monetize it.

Houghton Mifflin followed, in 1969, with ""The American Heritage Dictionary,"" but it also published a ""Clean Green"" edition without the word, to assure itself access to the public high school market. &gt;Written form attested at least from early 16c.; OED 2nd edition cites 1503, in the form fukkit, and the earliest attested appearance of current spelling is 1535 (""Bischops ... may fuck thair fill and be vnmaryit"" [Sir David Lyndesay, ""Ane Satyre of the Thrie Estaits""]). Presumably it is a more ancient word, but one not written in the kind of texts that have survived from Old English and Middle English [September 2015: the verb appears to have been found recently in an English court manuscript from 1310]. Buck cites proper name John le Fucker from 1278, but that surname could have other explanations. The word apparently is hinted at in a scurrilous 15c. poem, titled ""Flen flyys,"" written in bastard Latin and Middle English. The relevant line reads: &gt;*Non sunt in celi* &gt;*quia fuccant uuiuys of heli* This reasonably demonstrates that fucking predated screwing by upwards of 500 years. I would have to therefore disagree with your claim that ""to screw"" is a more widely understood term to best fit this particular joke.",0,1,0

dc9dn2l,"&gt; Illegal immigrants are ~3.4% of the population of the entire US. Deporting all of them would cripple the economy. I have heard this assertion a lot. I'm not sure what your basis is but the ones I've heard are that many economies are dependent on illegal immigrant labor. Here's the thing tho. Those economies are actually dependent on the **exploitation of illegal immigrant labor**, at the expense of legal immigrant/non-immigrant labor. Whether you deport them, give them a path to citizenship, give amnesty, legal labor is negatively affected. &gt; People who had no choice in crossing the border, due to their age, should be the first people excused from being punished for it through deportation. They're also the most likely to be well integrated into our society. That's why they get a free pass. I don't agree. Just because you have friends in the country is not a reason for an exception. Currently we don't even give exceptions to legal immigrants with friends in the country and a track record of contributing to the economy, why are we giving illegal immigrants special treatment? The US only accepts a specific number of immigrants into the country. There are US educated Master's/PhD graduates who are not allowed to stay because they do not win the Green Card/H1B lottery. It sucks but it's understandable because the country needs to control the increase in labor market supply. But because your parents snuck you in, you get special treatment?

dcgo0du,"&gt; My mom has diabetes and can't find an ACA plan that's cheaper than just paying the fine for being uninsured and paying out of pocket. This argument for not buying insurance is... dumb. I've known a couple people who told me something similar - it's cheaper to pay the fine than buy insurance, so they pay the fine. But you can't really compare the cost of insurance to the cost of the fine and just pick whatever is cheaper. Think about it this way: Let's say, for the sake of argument, the fine is $1000/yr for not having insurance. Paying for insurance will cost $1200/yr. The real cost of the insurance in this case is only $200/yr. Why? Because you're going to pay $1000 anyway. It's not your money anymore, subtract it from your income. When you subtract the cost of the fine, the plans look much much cheaper and is a great deal. Also, when you pay the fine it means you don't have health insurance and you're fucked if something goes wrong. Now of course there will be people who absolutely can't afford the extra $200 a year. That sucks. But I've heard this argument from people who could afford to buy health insurance but didn't because it was ""cheaper to pay the fine.""",0,1,0

Everyone else in the group was fed up with it on day one but it persisted. One of the other guys joined in, I think due to stockholm syndrome. Eventually it transpires this is a quote from a video, and the guy who started this tried to explain it, very badly. I will try to transcript his description: *So this guy is in the kitchen and he's dressed like a devil, and he's getting another guy to cook and he's making a huge mess and then this other guy walks in and says ""what's going on down there?"" and they reply ""breakfast!""* And ok I can kind of get why that's a bit funny but not ""constantly quoting it for days"" funny. Anyway there area where we're staying his kinda spotty internet but eventually we get fed up and my wife decides to look up this fucking video apparently called ""Nuts for Pudding"" on YouTube. And the whole thing is actually this 8 minute skit where this guy is trying to get in shape and find a girlfriend but a guy dressed as the devil is trying to encourage him to be lazy and eat like shit and this woman dressed as an angel is trying to encourage him to be better, and it ends with the angel and the devil having a fight in the back yard or something. And by the way all the actors in this presentation have Down Syndrome, so all the dialogue is kind of stilted but you know, overall, it wasn't a bad effort. So our buddy tells us he's never actually seen the whole video before, only the thirty second ""breakfast"" joke, and the entire video becomes his new obsession. The references double. When we return to civilization he discovers there are two more parts to this epic story and insists on subjecting it to us at our next gathering and I have to say they dont' quite capture the magic of the original.

Is it to try to appear masculine as to attract a woman on the fence or because they wish they were men and hate men b/c they aren't one? What is the reason? Another question is why are women attracted to manly looking women? Is it b/c they want to be with a guy and a girl at the same time and want the best of both worlds or b/c they want to be with a man, but don't like men so they go with a woman that looks like one? See, in my fantasy world, I would think that if a woman is attracted to women, she would want to be with a woman that looks like a woman. If she wanted someone that looked like a guy, she would be with a guy. If she wanted someone that looked like a guy and wanted pussy at the same time, she would be with a guy who liked 3somes.

c3e3qdj,"My sister and I are about six years apart, and she's on the Autism spectrum, has a pretty severe sensory disorder, and a speech disorder, and is so shy she will cry if someone talks to her in public. I'm pretty sure this happened when I was around 11, and she was a little under six. Well, at our mall they used to have this carousel, and it had a dragon and a pegasus on it. She was obsessed with dragons, I really liked carousels and peagsus... es. So one day we end up getting our mom to let us ride this thing, and we're the only people waiting in line. My sister went over to get my mom for something, but I pulled her back to the line and now there's this woman and her kid standing on the threshold to the entrance, but not actually IN the entrance. My mom had left to go to a store (the mall was pretty empty, but she isn't mom of the year, either). My sister and I get back in line, just as the ride is stopping from the people on it, and the lady pushes on my sister's shoulder. My sister is really upset, and the lady leans over at me and says, ""WE WERE FIRST IN LINE, GET BEHIND US."" So no not ruffle any feathers, we get behind her. They get on the ride and the shit bags take the only two carousel animals we wanted to use. Not only that, but my sister was crying (silently, it's really creepy) and I was pissed. As we're on the ride, this group of middle of high school students walk by and the guy among the gaggle points at us and yells ""FUCKING BABY LOSERS."" When we got off the ride, the woman scoffed at us and told us ""Maybe you should think about cutting people off next time you want to get on a ride."" I'm sure there are more shitty things, but I remember this one because it made my sister so upset and it should have been awesome. I still think about it whenever I go to the mall, but they've taken the carousel down.",0,1,0

My birthday party had to be cancelled, I had to call my friends and explain there was a family emergency. I was super bummed since your sweet sixteen is supposed to be a big deal. Once we arrived at the property, it became clear what kind of nightmare we were descending into. The tenants were IV drug users and had turned the house into a fucked up flop house. After the utilities were shut off months prior, they had dug a trench in the backyard to shit and piss into. The whole house was buried in about 2ft-3ft of vomit, needles, dog and human shit, garbage, etc. I remember a hamster cage bolted to the kitchen wall, 3ft of shit dripping down the wall from the base with a very dead hamster still in its wheel. My childhood bedroom had obviously been the kids room. I remember being hit with a flood of pleasant memories as I walked in, until I saw the filth those kids had been living in and totally lost it. My mom carried a pistol the whole time, fearful that they would make bail and come back while we emptied the place.

I've been drunk twice, and even then I remembered the night. This night I decided that I didn't really feel like drinking, and when they brought out drugs, I really wanted to leave [I'm not into that at all]. I said my goodnights, and went to go to bed in the music room which they'd put a mattress in for me. The room was basically a bedroom that they'd sound proofed so they could practice and whatnot. I was watching LOTR and this dude came in and was like, ""I'm so tired, can I sleep in here?"" I didn't know him, but I figured he was a friend of the hosts'. Then another dude came in like 45 minutes later with the same ""I'm so drunk and can't drive, can I sleep in here? the couches and stuff are taken."" Of course I bought it, and didn't even bother checking. About an hour after that, the house as quiet and I figured everyone had gone home. I fell asleep and woke up to one of them sitting on top of me, and putting tape over my mouth, and it progressed from there. I found out later, that no one knew those dudes, and that the guy I was staying with had gone home to his GF's house so their sex wouldn't wake me up. [ironic, no?] No knew that anyone was in the room but me, and no one checked. They guys pretty much made sure the house was clear before they tried anything. They used condoms, they had tape and rope ready. Looking back it was very planned, and executed like pros. Which is sickening. As far as advice goes, I'm sure it varied from person to person, but there's one thing that's retty universal: You can't scrub the feeling off. So when you take a shower don't cut yourself up with your nails trying to scrub harder. It won't help, and it will scar. Right after, stay away from hot water, as it burns terribly. And mostly: don't put creedence in a single thing the rapist says. When you start to remember what they called you, STOP THINKING. I couldn't get the words out of my head for a long time. About a year after it happened I was in a club, and a friend of mine offered me a shot by saying ""Fucking take it, bitch"" and I flashbacked so hard, I couldn't breathe.

c0iwg76,"Sophomore year of high school in Boerne, TX. Took a blow-off elective called ""Introduction to Business"" with a real bitch of a teacher. A significant portion of the grade was the notes. She put pre-printed sheets up on the projector, read them aloud, and we were expected to copy everything down in our notes. I decided my wrist was far more valuable to me at that point (I was serious about bowling at that point) so I began taking the notes in my own shorthand. At the end of the grading period, I turned in the notes and they were returned with a grade of zero. Obviously, my first thought was ""wtf?"", but I decided to use a connection I had. I walked out in the middle of her class and straight to the principal's office. I explained to him exactly what was going on, with the argument that the notes are supposed to be for my benefit, not hers, and that as long as I can read them there should be no issue. He called her in and asked her to bring a random page from earlier in the semester, gave me the date, and I read off (from my shorthand notes) almost exactly what the teacher's sheet said, minus a few a/an/the/etc. The principal told her that my grade was to be changed immediately and that he'd be speaking to the school board about the incident. I don't know what he said, but she wasn't teaching there the next year. My senior year, I had an Economics teacher try to write me up for being late to class. I was on crutches for that entire year (major hip surgery during the summer, took 18 months to get rid of the crutches) and on that particular day, it was pouring rain, so I was moving even slower than usual. I crumpled his first write-up and tossed it in the trash, right in front of him. He proceeded to write another, I told him ""You can keep writing them for the rest of the class, they're all going in the garbage. If you can't show respect the fact that I can't even walk, then you're a completely worthless human being and you have no business teaching.""

din1eev,"Our area is not too wealthy, but there are some very wealthy neighborhoods. $500K in the rust belt can buy you a lot of house and land. These people either own a bunch of shit or commute to high paying jobs in the big city 45 minutes away. Anyway, there are no really exclusive private schools, but there is a Catholic high school. Before the mid 80's it was affordable, and if you were catholic you'd send your kids there. Many folks took on extra work, volunteered, and kids worked in the cafeteria, etc. Some rich kids, but most were middle class. Now it is trying to be some kind of prep school. Normal middle class kids are barely able to afford tuition, and are made fun of if they aren't from money. They recruit some minority kids for sports, but most of the kids at this school have been so sheltered that they have never talked to a black person before, other than to tell them what to do. Many minority kids on scholarship have quit due to abuse, bullying, racism, and just plain awkwardness. One kid I know that went for basketball finally had enough because he was sick of the girls asking to touch his hair! Also, they would want to date him but would ignore him in school and in public. (basically took him back to the house for sex while mom and dad were in the Bahamas) Once, three kids broke into school, logged into a teacher's computer, and downloaded a bunch of porn to get him in trouble. They were all on camera, but only one kid got expelled. He happened to be dirt poor. (not excusing it, but the other two got NO punishment) Drugs are found regularly yet no one seems to get arrested, except for a couple of kids on scholarship. There is also a very rich suburban school district where the girls like to ""slum it"" with the city kids. They throw parties in daddy's house, but when something gets destroyed, the blame the city kids. I tell the city kids to stay the hell away from them. Here is an example of the contrast: I live in an 100 year old house in an OK neighborhood with a nice deck and a shitty above ground pool around it. We drive a used Kia and a used Taurus.

I was only able to climax during innercourse maybe 10% of the time. At times I even faked pulling out and pretending to cum on myself to avoid the embarassment of not being able to climax yet again. When I was younger, I more or less ruined my ability to have sex with women because I masturbated to porn for years. Back then, the masturbation sessions only lasted a couple of minutes at most, then I finished. This will sound strange... but I over the past couple of years, I transitioned from the couple minute long porn-watching masturbation sessions to literally hours on end. Keeping it going and going and going, finally climaxing hours later. I've gone at least 4 or 5 hours straight before. Now, I'm in my 30's and I've turned into this racehorse in the bedroom with women. I climax almost 100% of the time, and I'm having regular sex. I've had women rave about how long I last and how it's the best sex they've ever had.

The greatest ignorance about this whole drug problem is the nature of addictive behavior. That angry cracked out violent addict we are all afraid of is actually a product of 2 things. Scarcity, and addiction. See it isn't the drugs alone that make people addicts. It's the fact that in order to get the drug they need to spend most of their time earning money for it or looking for a source. This gives very little time for self management. And the act of searching for drugs like that is degrading. You feel worst about yourself, meaning you will also take worst care of yourself. If the drugs were made not illegal and we didn't constantly lie about their effects. Then we would have a more educated populace. People would largely still not do meth, crack etc. Because surprise fucking surprise most people don't like being drug addicts. If you give them the option to participate in society and do the drugs. They will usually choose to participate in society and not do the drugs. This is all proven by 2 experiments. One where they locked rats up in cages with a heroin laced water bottle. When the rats acted like drug addicts when the bottles were taken away. This experiment was retried by someone else later, because they thought the methods were flawed. They wanted to show that the reasons the rats showed the addictive behavior is because of the situation, not the drug. They showed that if you gave the rats the same options but didn't lock them up all alone in cages they would actually reject the (now morphine since heroin was unavailable to use at the time of the second experiment). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park So you are actually right, why not meth coke?

We were instructed to make a b-line from her office to the exit, straight faced, and without so much as looking at anyone. The 5-6 people called in before me were clearly trying to stifle their smiles as they left the office. Then I was called in and surprise surprise, I got the job!

""because she could smell them"" but we stopped brining chips so she had no evidence. eventually the principal noticed how many complaints she had sent down that where false and all about the same thing. they reviewed and fired her ass within 2 weeks. i just wanted to eat my chillie cheese fritos in peace but noooooo",0,1,0

cem7d44,"I know why I am not religious. It's more of a personal experience than a religious awakening of the sort. I was 17 and my parents just got divorced and my mom took it really hard, not in the I am going to overcome this situation and move on, more like I am going to do everything in my power to fuck my kids up and blame it on my dad. So, she moved us to another state away from him to live with a friend and her four kids. It was a nightmare it was in the middle of the winter in the middle of fucking nowhere and we were in high school which the closest one was an hour away. We (me and my year younger sister) had to walk a mile down a dirt road in the pitch black(only equipment with a flashlight) to make the school bus at 5:50am every morning. If that didnt suck bad enough it was in the middle of winter. Now my back story is pretty much the suburb kid that got whatever he wanted so this was new territory for me. The thing that sucked was that was my favorite part of the day because it got me away from the family we were living with which consisted of 4 kids ranging from 5-8. It got so bad and cramped that I was forced to sleep in a outside camper thing with my only heat source a freaking rv tub that had heat in it. So I would wake up once every 2-3 hours jump in the tub and turn the water on to warm myself up then go back to bed. I got so cold one night I couldn't even make it out of the mountain of blankets because my body was so wrapped tight trying to protect itself. At the very moment I decided you know what? Fuck this. I started blaming myself for the situation i was in..thinking the reason why I was the way I was was because i was not a good kid (I was failing out of high school and an overall dickhole). It just so happened less than a week later my mom forces of to move all our shit in the middle of the day (I assume we were no longer welcomed) and move back to the town where my dad lived. The final strew from my moms end was her kicking me out in a random city on the way home and me having to run to the nearest street sign to tell my dad what street I was on before my mom could cal lthe cell phone company to turn my phone off. Right after this happened..I got my GED, got a gf who is now my wife and got a full ride scholarship to a college that I graduated from (first in my family) and now have a great job inthat field. I owe it all to those shitty nights in that cold ass camper. It made me think that if you're good...good things will happen..and that's what i have been living by every since! [EDIT] Should also note that my mom took all her anger from the divorce out on me because I guess i reminded her of my dad(we look..act the same).

ddw1b1l,"We'll call him Brad, because fuck Brad. Brad was an asshole of the highest order. Brad was a salaried manager in the service industry, and over the course of six months, proved to be the cock-munchingest, thundercuntiest person I've ever had the misfortune of encountering. Brad was regularly guilty of acts of assholery. He was very insecure about his height (think [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-re0HMkldY)) and would verbally harass others about their physical traits in order to cover up his insecurity. While this is typical of bullies, Brad was in charge of about fifteen employees, and harassing them was not a great way to improve team morale. He had a pretty standard Napoleon complex. In addition to his verbal harassment, Brad often made remarks that bordered on sexual harassment - insulting his male employees regarding their sexual experience (or lack thereof), commenting on the bodies of female employees, and the like. I've been reliably informed that Brad had an exceptionally small penis, so it's possible his Napoleon complex extended to the sexual domain. In typical service industry fashion, Brad also abused the hell out of his hourly employees, requiring them to work long hours without breaks of any kind, and delegating a large quantity of the work he was expected to do as a salaried manager. This was because his second job - dealing drugs - took up much of his time. The most egregious example of douchebaggery was when Brad decided that it was appropriate to have a sexual relationship with one of his employees. This led to serious issues between the two, as well as with the team generally. Eventually, it became obvious that the relationship was both mentally and physically abusive. As is often tragically the case, the girl blamed herself for many of Brad's actions (gaslighting played a major role here) and eventually stopped taking birth control of hoping to get pregnant with Brad's kid. I'm sure you can sense where this is going. When she became pregnant, Brad refused to have anything to do with the pregnancy and absolved himself of any responsibility for it. He nonetheless maintained a sexual relationship with the girl, who spiraled into depression and suicidal tendencies before eventually getting an abortion. Fortunately, the girl eventually got out of the relationship with the help of myself and a few others. Brad no longer works in that position, and as I understand it he is doing rather poorly. Nonetheless, his actions deserved far more punishment than he got. **tl;dr fuck brad**",0,1,0

A few months later a buddy from the shop and I are heading back to my house, much earlier, 9pm or so, again no drinking, no drugs. We hit the same road, I instantly get an uneasy feeling. We hit a slight curve and slow down...and sure enough there it is again, the same thing.

I was raised to believe that family is the greatest bond you have, but having lived on my own for the last four years I have learned that that's not always the case. In fact, I've had more meaningful support from my boyfriend and our (his) friends than I ever have from my actual family. I say I deal with them because while they're meat eating, loud republicans, I'm the exact opposite. They're also incredibly racist.

If I were to cut ties, I wouldn't have anyone beside my S/o who could help me out of a jam. Over the last year or two I've come to accept that my mother and sister are no good for me emotionally and mentally. They constantly put my S/o down and demean my relationship with him, going as far as setting up actual dates with coworkers' sons, friends, etc. and guilt tripping me into visits on days I'm supposed to be with my S/o.

I was 20, she was divorced and in her late 20s. We hammered the details out on the phone beforehand: I was going to go to her hotel room at some point between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, shove the door open, and fuck her roughly without a word of conversation. I was incredibly nervous. I had her e-mail me the plan for the evening to me so I had some kind of proof of consent for legal reasons (weirdly, I was working as a sexual assault counselor at the time). I was already anticipating walking into the wrong room, so we agreed she'd shut her business card in the door to keep it unlocked. She wanted me to be rough with her. I had no idea what I was going to do. So I did it. I showed up at about 2:40, checked the door for her business card, swallowed hard, and pushed my way into the room. She was watching some hentai anime on her laptop. I stormed over to the bed, pushed her down, pulled her clothes partway off, and fucked her in the rudest manner I could muster. She was a few inches taller than me, so I couldn't just bear down and overpower her. I kept pinning her hands to the bed, or wrapping her arms in her shirt and holding them above her head, or pushing her face into the mattress, grabbing her throat, or pulling her hair. Any actual violence was limited to slapping her ass. We got to a point where I was fucking her from behind with one of her arms twisted behind her back and my fingers in her mouth. She was moaning and yowling in rhythm with me and I suddenly pushed her away roughly, grabbed my clothes, and left. I guessed that was a fitting end to the ""rape,"" since guys wouldn't hang around after they finished. I cleaned up in the bathroom in the lobby and waited, since we were supposed to go get something to eat afterwards. It was around 3:10 â€“ it had lasted for 30 minutes. I felt so weird about the whole situation that I left after waiting a few minutes. She left a message for me later that afternoon saying she really enjoyed what we did. I called her back and told her I had fun, but I was a little rattled and begged off the rest of our plans. I never saw her again, and we didn't talk online anymore after that. Looking back at everything, it was very awkward and creepy. I never once looked in her eyes. I didn't come. I held a blank expression on my face the whole time. To me, we just had 30 minutes of terribly awkward, uncomfortable, and laughably rude sex.

Everyone is allowed to have feelings. I'm gonna talk to you like a would if we were having a beer and I was actually trying to help you. Take a moment and try to really understand *why* it bothers you. If you can get identify the 'why' of it, you might be able to squash that notion in your head and get past it. How did you find out? If it wasn't by any dubious means, it's probably safe to mention to her. If she still is this type of girl like you hint at (flirty), and she took up drinking again, she might start being promiscuous. You have some valid concerns and they are worth talking about with her probably. She may even be able to put your mind at ease with some reassuring words. Even if she showed a little shame when you tell her that you know, I think that's a sign of personal change. And if not, then that's no big deal either. As long as she is monogamous from this point forward, I think *that* is what matters. I'm a pretty 'traditional' kind of guy in many respects. I'm very open about who works and who cleans and all that crap, but when it comes down to monogamy and such, I'm fucking serious. If I catch my gf flirting with another man, I'll yank her out of that situation pretty quick and let her know I don't stand for that. I don't flirt with other girls, and I expect the same from my monogamous partner. I'm very clear about it, and I think it's a fair expectation. And if that's important to you and not her, you may not be a good match. If it's not the promiscuity thing that is bothering you, it might be your judgment of her personal character that is bothering you. You might be disgusted by her. If that is the case, you are judging her and you think what she did was *wrong*. Try to understand why you think that is a wrong thing to do. Personally for me, I know there are lots of girls out there who are empowered and just enjoying sex, but I also know there are a lot of girls out there who are so desperate for attention to bolster their self-esteem, that they will gladly take a dicking down from 3 guys at the same time to get that validation. That is a turn off to me. I don't know your girl, so I can't say which is the case. Did she have a father that gave her enough attention as a child? That's often an indicator, but **not always**. If the latter is the case though, I wouldn't damn her. People grow and improve (usually) as they age. Also, is your source valid? Maybe you were lied to or the situation was exaggerated.

ddovlke,"Ok, this one is on me. About 6 years ago, my wife was pregnant with our second child and had been on bedrest for a couple months. Complicated pregnancy, she had pre-eclampsia, so her blood pressure was elevated for quite a while. She was due in mid-march, but it was becoming increasingly clear that she would have to be induced early. By this point she was absolutely miserable. So that was the setting for our valentine's day. Now the last piece of background you need to know is that my wife and I are both big-time gamers. Video games eat up the vast majority of our free-time. She's a fan of the Cooking Mama series for one. Well I had no clue what to get her for V-day that year and so I was jus hoping to find some last minute inspiration at the store. Naturally I went to the electronics section and checked out the video games. And lo and behold, there was a brand new game in the ""Mama"" series! And it came with a special controller! And it was all very cute! It was an obvious buy and, hopefully, the perfect gift to brighten her mood. And that is how on the most romantic day of the year, one day before giving birth to our second child, concluding an absolutely miserable pregnancy, my wife received a copy of Babysitting Mama with a special baby doll controller. When she opened it she just looked up at me and brutally snapped ""Are you fucking kidding me?"" I was all ""What? you love the Cooking Mama games! And it's such an appropriate gift, considering the circumstances."" To which she responded ""I'm about to taking care of a newborn for real 24 hours a day! I'm going to be missing sleep, getting spit up on, changing diapers and all the other shit that comes with a new baby and you think I'd want to spend what precious few recreation minutes I'll get pretending to do all that same shit!?"" Um, well once you put it that way, yeah that seems pretty epically stupid, doesn't it? So I returned it and I think she ended up getting some flowers and a fuzzy throw blanket or something. I suck at giving gifts. TL:DR- I tried to cheer up my miserable, stressed out wife with the opportunity to pretend to do all the stressful things she was about to be doing for real. I'm a dumbass.",0,1,0

cf3gc3e,"Not stupid rule that's enforced, I understand why it is, but its annoying. In 7/8th grade we got computers. These were nice computers, But we had to be very, very careful. Well they were actually laptops. Well one day, I was talking to a friend and I kinda forget what happened but I dropped my laptop. Fucking. Damnit. The worst teacher, the bitchiest teacher, was there and saw it. Opened it up - worked wonderful. Then I realized I bent the casing. Not horribly but enough to make it scrape together. Ugh ugh ugh. So I start going to my moms work, and after 2 weeks nobody has noticed its bent. Yes. So I have about $100 saved up, I've talked to a few computer stores and to fix it it was like a $100. Not to bad. So I go up to the teacher, explain everything, explain how I talked to a computer store and how it was a cheap fix, and I had the money. She was surprised at how I owned up to it, and while it was gone, I of course couldn't use the computer. So, despite being an adult and owning to it, paying for it, what happens? They have to, 'follow the rules', and I'm banned from computers. Completely. Not allowed to even touch them. And half of our homework is word documents - ok. I can do those at home. And, power points. Which I can't. So I basically went from a 3.5 student to 2.0 because I couldn't do half of them. Luckily at highschool I picked up, and did well, but still, fuuucccckkk. Still annoys me because our teacher was very nice about the whole thing and happy I owned to it, but of course the principal didnt give a fuck. I understand why being banned, but I felt I handled it well enough I should be given the computer to use. I mean, I completely paid for the casing and even set it up to be fixed.... |:",0,1,0

c0krf2a,"1. Don't ask how to do things. Don't tell them you're a virgin. Bullshit it. 2. Sex isn't rocket science. I know it sounds hard before you've actually done it, and there is a lot of anxiety- but you just need to stop worrying about the sex itself. 3. People drink on dates for a reason. It increases attraction, decreases tension and generally you stop being anxious about it. Get her drunker than you are, and be buzzed yourself for an optimal first time. 4. Penis goes in vagina. Clitoris is at top of vagina. Don't stimulate it directly. It's just like your penis- direct stimulation on the head for more than a second is less than comfortable for most women. The shaft goes into her body just like your penis does, and you can use that to your advantage. 5. Be prepared for various juices. 6. Women don't expect you to have tons of experience. They just don't want a guy who acts like a little boy. Feign confidence. Ask yourself what would rambo do in this situation? Rambo wouldn't be like 'does this hurt' 'oh sorry' 'oops' 'does this' 'what should i'... he would get in there and get it done his way. 7. Don't be afraid to be a little rough and don't apologize for little shit. Also, don't let her know you're grossed out by anything. 8. If you're not like a 30+ year old virgin you can still just wait for a girl you're comfortable with. Don't just bang a random slut just because you have the v card because that experience is going to suck much more than it would with someone you were comfortable with. 9. Don't try to fuck them the first date. Or the second. Not the third either unless there's great chemistry. They'll often get the vibe that you just want them for sex or that you don't respect yourself/them. 10. Back to some previous points- CONFIDENCE. QUIT POSTING SHIT LIKE THIS ON THE INTERNET. DONT EVEN THINK IT. YOU ARE A SEXUAL DEMON NOW. YOU WILL DESTROY THAT VAG. K? 11. CONDOM. Even if she says she's on the pill. CONDOM.",0,1,0

That goes for you girls too. Stop duck-facing in pictures. It's unattractive. Edit: Boy, did I open a can of worms. According to the 10 PMs and many more replies you all have been completely shut down by girls a lot. If I could fix it, I would. I can only offer what i know to be true from my experience as a woman being courted by others and also successfully hitting on and having relationships with women. So let me clarify: Be sensitive: Don't be a dick. That's what I mean. The idea that you need to be an asshole to girls in order to get their attention is bullshit. Why would you ever want to be in a relationship with someone who only responds to being treated like dirt? I can guarantee you that girl is a mess and will turn out to be crazy. Be honest: Stop trying to be someone you aren't. Girls can spot bullshit from a mile away. If you think you are fooling us with your cheap cologne, arrogance, fake stories about how you make 6 figures, terrible pick up lines, etc, you aren't.
